Take a peek and see the full game lineup .
<START:location> SAN FRANCISCO <END> —After five years , <START:organization> Gary Danko <END> has been dethroned as the top restaurant in the SF <START:organization> Zagat Survey <END> .
Find out who took its place .
<START:location> FILLMORE <END> <START:organization> —The Progress <END> , the new restaurant from <START:person> Stuart Brioza <END> and <START:person> Nicole Krasinski <END> of <START:organization> State Bird Provisions <END> , is located right next door—and it 's getting very close to opening .
Everybody panic !
<START:location> SAN FRANCISCO <END> — Tomorrow is SantaCon , so you may want to get out of town , or at least paper your restaurant , bar , or home with these nifty Eater " No Drunk Santas " signs .
Meanwhile , the people who invented SantaCon ( right here in SF! ) are holding a funeral for it .
<START:location> BERKELEY <END> —Poutine from the <START:location> Great White North <END> has arrived in the <START:location> Great Hippie South <END> , as <START:location> Berkeley <END> notched the very first <START:location> U.S. <END> location of Canadian chain <START:organization> Smoke <END> 's <START:organization> Poutinerie <END> .
<START:location> SoMa <END> <START:location> —Second Street <END> is getting enlivened by the debut of <START:organization> SOMA Eats <END> , a new cafe/coffee shop/beer and wine bar/artisan bottle shop .
<START:location> UNION SQUARE <END> —As if Brewcade was n't enough , beer fans can now also get their drink on at new bar <START:organization> Hogwash <END> , which boasts 30 taps , housemade sausages , and pony kegs delivered to your table .
<START:location> SAN FRANCISCO <END> —Would you pay $ 5 for a last-minute table at <START:organization> Flour + Water <END> , <START:organization> Bar Agricole <END> , or <START:organization> Outerlands <END> ?
New app <START:organization> Reserve <END> is betting the answer is yes .

First came <START:organization> AMC <END> 's <START:organization> Mad Men <END> , whose brown <START:organization> Frigidaires <END> and <START:organization> Eero Saarinen <END> tables helped ignite a craze for everything midcentury , modern , and whiskey-spiked .
Now <START:person> Amanda Kolson Hurley <END> writes for <START:organization> City Lab <END> that <START:organization> BBC America <END> 's <START:organization> The Game <END> is poised to do the same for <START:organization> Brutalism <END> .
In the spy thriller , " surprisingly intimate " concrete rooms are practically characters in and of themselves .
The spy HQ , what with its "rough , ribbed-concrete walls , " takes the harshest parts of the style and inhabits it with real human being feelings again .
What 's more , the building is actually home to the good guys rather than sociopaths .
Here a Brutalist icon serves as the hub for a bunch of well-dressed folk fighting for Queen and country .
As <START:person> Hurley <END> writes , "it makes Brutalism the scene of interactions that for once are n't thuggish or sinister . "

<START:person> Architect Chris Downey <END> is standing next to a pile of Sheetrock , balancing a white cane in the air like a tightrope walker 's pole .
The week before , construction had begun on a new office for the <START:organization> Independent Living Resource Center <END> of <START:location> San Francisco <END> , or <START:organization> ILRC <END> , a nonprofit community center for people with disabilities .
<START:person> Downey <END> holds the cane up to approximate for the center 's executive director , <START:person> Jessie Lorenz <END> , how the reception desk will jut out at an angle from a concrete column .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> takes a step , and a pile of pipes on the floor clatters .
" I do n't know what 's over there , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> giggles .
" I hope I did n't break anything , " she says .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> regains her footing and touches the cane .
" That makes sense , " she says .
" It 's almost like we 're funneling people into this part . "
Even though <START:person> Lorenz <END> , who , like <START:person> Downey <END> , is blind , ca n't see the space before her , she knows exactly what to expect .
On her desk at the <START:organization> ILRC <END> 's current office on Mission Street , she keeps a tactile floor plan that <START:person> Downey <END> printed for her .
The plan 's fine web of raised lines looks like an elaborate decorative pattern , suggesting a leaf of handmade stationery or a large sheet from which doilies are about to be cut .
Though <START:person> Downey <END> has consulted on other architects ' projects since going blind six years ago , this one marks a turning point for him .
The community center is the first space he 's designed since losing his sight .
The center recently opened its doors to the public with a celebration to inaugurate the new space , located on <START:location> Howard Street <END> in the city 's <START:location> Yerba Buena <END> district , just down the block from the <START:location> Moscone convention center <END> .
But on this May afternoon , the walls are just beginning to go up .
[ <START:person> Chris Downey <END> at the new <START:organization> ILRC <END> .

<START:person> Lorenz <END> and her guide dog , a German shepherd named <START:person> Phoenix <END> , head deeper into the building to check out the storage room , and <START:person> Downey <END> makes his way to the storefront , where the conference room looks out onto <START:location> Howard <END> .
Other than a few scant rays of afternoon sunlight slanting in through the window , it 's dark .
The floor is scattered with the guts of the future office—cables , pipes , and more Sheetrock—obstacles <START:person> Downey <END> weaves around with his cane .
There 's sort of a ropes-course , trust-fall quality to touring a dimly lit construction site with someone who ca n't see .
He tells me where we are , and I tell him where not to step .
<START:person> Downey <END> makes his way to the open office area , where cubicles will eventually go .
At 51 , he is tall , trim , and nearly bald , with a light fuzz of whitening hair just above his ears and intensely blue eyes .
<START:person> Downey <END> gave up his daily bike commute when he lost his sight , but he still moves with the assurance of someone who could hop on a bicycle and take off at any moment .
He pauses , listens , and makes a few exploratory taps on the floor with his cane .
" I was trying to see if they had framed up the wall between the conference room and the" —more tapping —" Yeah , this is it , " he says as he finds the wall with his cane .
" The windows will sit here .
It 's a pretty good-size opening to get that light and view into the general office . "
<START:person> Downey <END> is gesturing at the street and making eye contact as he says this , and for a moment this feels like any other construction tour .
Then the front door swings open and <START:person> Dwight Ashdown <END> , principal of the <START:location> San Francisco <END> firm <START:organization> Ashdown Architecture <END> and <START:person> Downey <END> 's partner on the project , strides in .
He reaches around the side of an unfinished wall and flips a switch .
Light floods the space as the overhead lights flicker to life .
No one had thought to turn them on .
For most of his life , <START:person> Chris Downey <END> could see .
Seven years ago , he started to notice blind spots in his vision .
At the time , he was managing the architectural practice of a green modular-housing firm in <START:location> Oakland <END> and cycling 100 miles a week .
He began to have trouble following the ball during baseball games with his son , <START:person> Renzo <END> .
After new glasses did n't fix the problem , an MRI revealed a benign tumor pressing on his optic nerve .
His own father , a physician , had died of complications from a brain tumor at the age of 36 , when <START:person> Downey <END> was seven .
On St . Patrick 's Day , 2008 , <START:person> Downey <END> checked into the hospital .
It took the doctors nine and a half hours to remove the tumor .
When he woke up , the world was blurry .
He could distinguish <START:person> Renzo <END> and his wife , <START:person> Rosa <END> , as colors and shapes but could not make out the details of their faces .
At first , this was a sign of normal recovery .
But the next day , the bottom half of <START:person> Downey <END> 's visual field was dark , as though he were partly submerged in ink .
The day after , even the blurred vision was gone , replaced by changing sensations of light and dark .
By the fifth day , everything had gone black .
After the doctors told him there was nothing more they could do , a social worker came by his hospital room to talk about the future .
" One of the first things she commented on was that I was an architect , and we could talk about career 'alternatives ' —that was her word , " <START:person> Downey <END> recalls .
" After that I did n't hear much else . "
[ <START:person> Downey <END> and <START:person> Lorenz <END> adjust floorplans . ]
Even though leaving architecture felt wrong , staying seemed equally preposterous .
" I questioned it initially , like—how ? " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
No sooner had he asked the question than he began to think of answers .
Quite a few of his job duties were supervisory—managing relationships , helping his staff think through design problems—and he could handle those without being able to see .
<START:person> Downey <END> approached his bosses .
" When I pitched the idea , ' Can I come back ? ' they were quick to say yes , " he says .
" They were absolutely sure that I 'd be able to figure it out ."
Within a month , he was back at the firm part-time .
Rosa <START:person> Downey <END> , who is also an architect ( the couple met as junior designers at the <START:location> Boston <END> firm <START:organization> Schwartz/Silver Architects <END> in 1987 ) , drove him to work every day .
Since he did n't have command of a cane yet , <START:person> Downey <END> spent his days either in his chair or being led around the office by colleagues .
That fall , a technology trainer he was working with found him an embossing printer —a specialty technology normally used in educational settings to print braille and tactile graphics .
With a good bit of tinkering , <START:person> Downey <END> and his trainer got it to print floor plans from PDFs .
It was a lucky fluke .
The PDF format is common currency in the architecture profession , and having a piece of technology that could read it meant he could participate without asking anyone to adopt another technology .
But <START:person> Downey <END> still had no way of getting his own ideas onto paper .
The language of the industry he had worked in for 20 years was trapped on inscrutably flat pieces of paper or locked away in electrons on a screen .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> , who first learned of <START:person> Downey <END> through a mutual friend , recalls talking with him after he lost his sight .
" There are a lot of people that would 've just been like , 'OK , this is an opportunity to change career paths , '" she says .
" It was clear to me early on that packing up shop was n't on his list of options for himself . "
<START:person> Downey <END> saw his blindness as a particularly gnarly design problem—a high-stakes version of the intentionally mindboggling assignments from his graduate student days at the <START:organization> University of California , Berkeley <END> 's <START:organization> College of Environmental Design <END> .
" You get that incredible challenge in school , where you 're scratching your head , like , ' Oh my God , where 's this going to take me ? ' says <START:person> Downey <END> .
" That can be incredibly terrifying . "
But he does n't sound like a person shaped by terror .
Instead , the thought of being asked to do something ridiculously hard seems to make him giddy .
A few months after going back to work , <START:person> Downey <END> picked up the phone and called the California Architects Board , the state licensing authority .
" I said , ' Uh , I 've got a friend who 's an architect , and he 's licensed ; he lost his sight .
Can he , ah , keep his license ? ' "
<START:person> Downey <END> recalls .
" They were like , ' He 's passed his exam , he 's got his license ? ' "
<START:person> Downey <END> said yes . " They said , ' He 's got it for life .
As long as he pays his fees . '"
We think of architecture as a visual discipline , but vision is just one of our spatial senses .
Close your eyes , after all , and the room around you is still there .
When <START:person> Downey <END> lost his sight , his curiosity about the way environments are constructed did n't go away ; it simply shifted to his other senses .
When he could see , <START:person> Downey <END> often sketched as a way of sorting out architectural details he found puzzling .
Now he taps his cane to get a sense of the volume of the space he 's in , or he 'll touch a wall or a transition point in the building to figure out how it 's put together .
He does n't use a guide dog , because he would lose that intimate contact with the landscape .
" I 'm often trying to understand as much of the architectural space and form as I can , " he says .
The listening skills required practice , but the tactile ones did n't .
" As kids we learn through touch , before our visual system is fully developed , " he explains .
<START:person> Downey <END> 's years of cycling also gave him a feel for the modulations of the streets , down to the dips and crests of the roads around his <START:location> Piedmont <END> home .
Whenever people ask his wife for directions , <START:person> Downey <END> invariably answers .
<START:person> [Jessie Lorenz <END> and <START:person> Phoenix <END> . ]
When he 's pressed for time , or just trying to travel efficiently from place to place , <START:person> Downey <END> does n't bother with trying to create that mental model of his surroundings .
" I 'm just connecting points , " he says , " to find , ' This is the flow that works through here . '"
In those instances , he experiences space as essentially bland .
" You could think of it like a really monotonous environment that is sort of frustrating or confusing because everything 's the same , " he says .
" Like a convention center or airport . "
( One exception : <START:location> Chicago O'Hare <END> , <START:person> Downey <END> 's favorite airport , because the concourse 's terrazzo floors and vaulted glass skylight bounce sound in a legible way , leaving a kind of sonic breadcrumb trail . )
For the most part , places that tend to be dull for the sighted world also do little for people who ca n't see : think low , undifferentiated ceilings and vast swaths of carpet tile .
Carpet dampens sound , and the unchanging ceiling , when sounds bounce off it , gives no indication of which direction is which .
Think of being trapped in the world 's largest DMV .
After he lost his sight , <START:person> Downey <END> found that buildings he appreciated in his prior life offered him new multisensory riches .
When he visited <START:person> Louis Kahn <END> 's <START:organization> Kimbell Art Museum <END> in <START:location> Fort Worth , Texas <END> , he was surprised to find that he could intuit the layout of the galleries through the floor texture .
Bands of travertine trace the path of the structural grid , interspersed with intervals of wood .
" Having those bands begins to modulate the space , " he says .
" Kahn would 've done that for a visual modulation , " but the architect might have been thinking texturally as well .
" I 've since learned that he was getting pretty blind by the time he did that building , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
" He almost had to have his face right on the drawings to be able to see them . "
<START:person> Downey <END> remained at the modular-housing firm through the end of 2008 .
The recession had deepened , and banks had all but quit underwriting loans in the niche market of unconventional prefab homes .
<START:person> Downey <END> survived several rounds of cuts that fall , but just before the holidays , he was laid off .
With the building industry at a near standstill , prospects were grim even for architects who could see .
In early 2009 , <START:person> Downey <END> got in touch with a business adviser , who connected him with the <START:location> Oakland <END> firm <START:organization> Design Partnership <END> .
As it happened , that firm was collaborating with SmithGroup on a new polytrauma and blind rehabilitation center for the <START:location> Palo Alto <END> veterans ' hospital .
SmithGroup hired him to consult on the project .
Far from being unemployable , <START:person> Downey <END> found himself in possession of a rare combination of skills .
Here were two groups that had little in common : blind people and the hypervisual architects who design spaces .
In the Venn diagram linking them , <START:person> Downey <END> was a set of one .
( In the US , at least .
In <START:location> Portugal <END> , the architect <START:person> Carlos Mourão Pereira <END> has maintained a practice since losing his sight in 2006 .
The two met in 2009 in a <START:location> New York <END> <START:organization> Starbucks <END> , in what they dubbed the first-ever <START:organization> International Blind Architects Conference <END> . )
Since landing that initial consulting job on the veterans ' rehabilitation center , <START:person> Downey <END> has carved out a niche helping a visual industry locate its blind spots .
His portfolio has swelled with health-care projects , including the <START:organization> Duke Eye Center <END> in <START:location> Durham <END> , North Carolina , and transportation work has picked up , too .
In 2012 <START:person> Pelli Clarke Pelli <END> , the architect working on <START:location> San Francisco <END> 's 1.5-million-square-foot Transbay Transit Center , asked <START:person> Downey <END> to help chart a legible path for visually impaired passengers along what will be a four-block-long bus depot .
<START:person> Downey <END> 's copy of the floor plan , which he printed on his embossing printer , measures more than 16 feet long .
The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) includes requirements for the visually impaired , not all of them attentively enforced .
Measures like braille signage and tactile paving ( those bumpy strips that signal a transition from sidewalk to street ) are universal .
But <START:person> Downey <END> has found that design teams often overlook rules governing protruding objects like diagonal braces or wall sconces , which are too high to detect with a cane but not high enough to ensure that no one will walk into them .
" A lot of architects I 've talked with , it 's not willful —they do n't know it 's an issue , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
" You can see when somebody ca n't roll up stairs or reach from a wheelchair to get something .
" It 's hard to visualize what it 's like to see from behind somebody else 's eyes . "
Even when followed to the letter , the ADA rules do n't address how someone with poor eyesight experiences a place .
Without sight , curving paths are particularly vexing , especially if the path is texturally identical to everything around it .
" You have to have something tactile to work around that curvature , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
" How do you know what the radius is ?
Even if you knew , how would you calibrate that into your mind to walk the radius ? "
For the same reason , round furniture is problematic ; there 's no way to walk away and know for certain where you 're going .
<START:person> Downey <END> recently toured a blind rehab center in Southern California where all the reception desks are round .
To give patients a way to orient themselves , the center added rubber tabs under the countertops to line up with particular corridors—the equivalent of a sign hidden under a table .
For more than a decade , the ILRC has been tucked away on the third floor of a brick mid-rise on <START:location> Mission Street <END> .
When the elevator breaks—which is often—the ILRC employees who use wheelchairs ca n't go to work , and would-be visitors in wheelchairs are out of luck .
" We have a youth group that meets on Wednesdays after hours , " says <START:person> Lorenz <END> .
" There 'll be , like , 10 minors in there , being young and crazy and having fun , and I 'm sitting in this office deep-breathing , thinking , ' Oh my gosh , if that elevator breaks and these kids are up here . '"
Two years ago <START:person> Lorenz <END> visited the ground-floor space on <START:location> Howard Street <END> , and she 's been fundraising for the move ever since .
Beyond the obvious boon to safety , having a street presence will raise the center 's profile .
" Our work is about keeping people who have a disability involved , engaged , and employed , " says <START:person> Lorenz <END> .
Joining the public realm is an important part of that .
" We need a place where we can be an actual community center . "
When <START:person> Lorenz <END> issued a call for architects in January , she needed to move quickly .
The center had to open in its new space in six months , and she had parted ways with the initial architect .
<START:person> Downey <END> had just wrapped up a semester guest-lecturing at <START:organization> Berkeley <END> 's <START:organization> School of Architecture <END> , where he teaches an introductory class on the ADA and universal design .
He was consulting on some transportation projects , including the bus terminal at the <START:location> Transbay Transit Center <END> , and looking ahead to another year of piecework .
When he got an email from <START:person> Lorenz <END> inviting him to bid on her project , "it was out of the blue , " recalls <START:person> Downey <END> .
At first he assumed that she wanted him to bid as part of a team with another architect .
But as he examined the email more closely , he realized he was the only one on it .
" I was like , ' Wait a minute , '" he recalls , " 'it 's addressed to me ! ' "
As a consultant , <START:person> Downey <END> did n't have a full-services architecture firm behind him , and there was n't time to start one .
He called <START:person> Ashdown <END> , an old colleague at the <START:location> San Francisco <END> firm <START:organization> Holt Henshaw <END> , where he had worked in the '90s .
For a few years in the 2000s , they ran a firm together , <START:organization> Ashdown Downey Architecture and Design <END> .
They formed a team , with <START:person> Downey <END> as the lead architect .
<START:person> Ashdown <END> , the architect of record , would handle the construction documentation and sign off on the drawings .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> and her staff interviewed three teams .
" <START:person> Chris <END> and <START:person> Dwight <END> charmed everyone , " she says .
When <START:person> Downey <END> and <START:person> Ashdown <END> won the project , they inherited the prior architect 's floor plan .
The conference room and reception area sat side by side in the storefront ; in the back , an open office area was ringed by private offices .
That layout set the center up to profit from its location next to Moscone—they plan to rent out the conference room for meetings—but it also meant that most of the center 's daily activities would stay hidden from the street .
Passersby who happened to look in would see , most of the time , an empty conference room and a reception area staffed by one or two people .
Not much daylight would reach the workstations in the rear .
" I was really obsessed with finding a way to get light and views back into the office , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
He 's sitting at a large table at the office space he rents on <START:location> Annie Alley <END> in downtown <START:location> San Francisco <END> .
When he works on his laptop , he keeps one earbud in to listen to his computer 's audible interface .
The interface works with anything text-based—email , word processing , PowerPoint—but it ca n't help him draw in CAD programs .
<START:person> Downey <END> needed something tactile to work with , and he found it in a kids ' toy .
Spread out before him on the table are stacks of embossed plans like the one in <START:person> Lorenz <END> 's office , but these are marked up with brightly colored wax sticks .
Straight out of the box , the sticks are long and thin , like rigid threads of licorice .
<START:person> Downey <END> had run across them in his former life , when a waitress handed a packet to his son in lieu of crayons .
But he only learned of their application as a drawing tool in 2009 , the year after he lost his sight .
That summer he served as a mentor for blind high schoolers in an introductory architecture course put on by the <START:organization> National Federation of the Blind <END> .
Architecture professors from the <START:organization> University of Maryland , College Park <END> , had the students applying wax sticks to paper to create drawings and three-dimensional forms .
The sticks warm to the touch and bend easily ; they can make precise angles , and—crucially for Downey—their tackiness makes them stick to paper .
" Once I realized that , I thought , ' Oh , I could use that to draw on top of an embossed drawing . '"
Suddenly , he had a way not just to read , but to make .
<START:person> Downey <END> uses the wax sticks as an informal tool for sketching on top of working plans .
Once he has something he wants to bring to <START:person> Lorenz <END> , he snaps a photo with his phone—the shot is always a guess , but often there 's someone on hand to frame it up —and emails it to <START:person> Ashdown <END> .
<START:person> Ashdown <END> edits the computer file , which <START:person> Downey <END> can then print with the embosser .
The drawing in front of him indicates the reception desk with a red and yellow chevron .
It also reflects the change <START:person> Downey <END> made to get light and views into the back of the <START:organization> ILRC <END> office .
He rejiggered the floor plan so that the open office area in the rear backs straight up onto the conference room .
He added a big window between the two , and brought the sill low enough that people moving around the office in wheelchairs could see out—and also be seen from the street .
" To me it was important that you see people with disabilities working inside , " he says .
<START:person> Lorenz <END> and <START:person> Downey <END> found themselves in the ironic situation of making visual decisions that everyone but them would be able to see .
For <START:person> Lorenz <END> , who has been blind since birth , ceilings were hard to wrap her mind around .
" Honestly , if you 've never seen a ceiling , it 's not really something people go around describing to you , " she says .
<START:person> Downey <END> made <START:person> Lorenz <END> a tactile drawing to illustrate the different ceiling finishes and changing heights , which follow the logic of the office layout .
A low wood-slat ceiling at the entrance fans into the reception area at a rakish angle , offering a warm ( and higher-dollar ) flourish where it counts .
Then the ceiling lifts and opens up to the mechanical conduits—which are painted white—to make the most of the available volume .
In the back , the perimeter offices have drop ceilings , and the ceiling over the staff workstations is open .
<START:person> Downey <END> brought <START:person> Lorenz <END> samples of the wood slat ceiling to feel .
" I felt like a ceiling expert , " says <START:person> Lorenz <END> .
" <START:person> Chris <END> was able to break it down for me in a way that was really understandable .
I do n't want to make a decision that I do n't understand .
I 'm way too type A for that . "
On the last Saturday of July , the new <START:organization> Independent Living Resource Center <END> opened its doors .
With yellow walls and polished concrete floors , it 's lighter and brighter than the old space .
( <START:person> Downey <END> recused himself from the color discussion , enlisting Rosa <START:person> Downey <END> to handle the color palette . )
The receptionist , who is blind , greets everyone who walks in , so that visitors who have visual impairments have an audible target to approach .
With an office of this size and floor plan—a very legible progression of boxes—Downey did n't need to build in the kinds of wayfinding cues , such as changes in the floor texture , that would be necessary in a larger building .
" Not that I 'd be so bold as to say no one will ever get confused in there , " <START:person> Downey <END> says , " but it 's a pretty straightforward floor plan , and where it 's not there 's somebody there to intercede . "
When <START:person> Downey <END> walks through the center , he conjures a mental image of the space he designed .
But compared with a crisp memory from his sighted days , the <START:organization> ILRC <END> will always have the hazy edges of an approximation .
" I recognize it as my perception of the space , and it 's been confirmed by my experience feeling the space , but I do n't have that visual confirmation , " he says .
" It 's hard for me to put it together with the same degree of clarity and absoluteness with all the colors and things in my mind .
With it comes some degree of a question . "
For now , <START:person> Downey <END> 's ability to do his job rests on the whims of the adaptive technology industry .
The manufacturer of his embossing printer , ViewPlus , recently discontinued the product .
" I'll have to go on eBay and buy up all the printers I can find , " says <START:person> Downey <END> .
" There are n't too many of them out there . "
But the profession as a whole is acquiring new tools for visual accessibility .
In June , <START:person> Downey <END> flew to Minneapolis to join researchers working on rendering software that will simulate the effects of poor vision .
The project , called <START:organization> Designing Visually Accessible Spaces <END> ( DEVA ) , aims to create a filter that would allow architects to " see " what their designs would look like from behind different sets of eyes .
With that kind of knowledge , design teams could evaluate lighting and color schemes for potential hazards .
The initiative , led by University of Minnesota psychology professor <START:person> Gordon Legge <END> , is in its early stages , but the team recently received a second round of funding from the <START:organization> National Institutes of Health <END> .
<START:organization> DEVA <END> could ultimately create a bridge between scientific research into visual impairment and the architects who can make use of that research in the real world , <START:person> Downey <END> says .
" It 's a tool where people who can make a difference could make a difference . "

In the hands of Canadian firm <START:organization> La SHED Architecture <END> , a dreary , well-worn duplex in <START:location> Montreal <END> is now completely unrecognizable .
Gone are the odd wallpaper and aged furnishings : after a massive renovation last year , the 2,700-square-foot home is all about bright lighting , vibrant colors , and versatile spaces .
As <START:organization> Dwell <END> notes , the architects only preserved the building 's "overall shape and footprint . "
Otherwise , the changes are drastic .
A new open-plan area for the kitchen and double-height living room has been opened up , with a home office hovering on the mezzanine above .
The kitchen has been recast in white lacquer and outfitted with stainless-steel countertops .
Standing out in the whole space is the intense orange-lacquer staircase right by the steel bookshelves .
Other transformations include the master bath , where a larger skylight showers the polished space with natural light , as well as the new patio carved out from the middle of the second floor .
Of course , with a budget of $ 400K , which is what was reported on the project page , this sort of extreme makeover is to be expected .
Here are some before-and-afters of the house 's kitchen , master bath , and rear .

Back in September , a deeply Ft .
Lauderdale spectacle by the name of <START:location> Le Palais Royal <END> hopped on the market at a staggering $ 139M , instantly becoming <START:location> America <END> 's most expensive home for sale .
Since then , the yet-to-be-completed megamansion has been dethroned by an $ 195M Beverly Hills compound and is now the country 's third most expensive listing , right behind the $ 140M <START:location> Hamptons <END> pad that listed last month .
Now , a fresh batch of construction photos show that , to the horror of <START:organization> Curbed <END> commenters who deemed the property " the Titanic of mansions , " a "pulsating nightmare , " an "architecturally bastardized mess , " the home is coming along exactly as promised by the initial renderings .
Expected to be completed next summer , the 60,000-square-foot palace will offer 11 bedrooms , a 492-foot private dock , an underground garage for over 30 cars , " the first-ever <START:organization> IMAX <END> Theater contracted for private use , " and a $ 2M marble staircase—the enticing makings of a property that , according to listing agent <START:person> William Pierce <END> , has attracted " a great deal of interest " from buyers around the world .

Is this space "feminine " ?
How about "ladylike " ?
Photo via <START:organization> Design Sponge <END>
Others have made the point before , but the ongoing use of the words "masculine " and "feminine " in design writing has us , the staff of <START:organization> Curbed National <END> , feeling it needs to be stated again , as clearly as possible : the people who write about decor and design need to stop describing spaces with gendered terms .
It 's an easy fix .
Decor bloggers , shelter editors , design writers : do n't type the words "masculine " or "manly " or "feminine " or "ladylike " or "girly " when describing spaces .
Do n't use any other words that prescribe gender to furniture or interiors .
Let 's say two spaces were written up in a decor blog , and one was described as masculine , and the other feminine .
Which would have white walls ?
Which would have raw concrete floors ?
Which would remind you more of <START:organization> Pinterest <END> ?
Which would have more heavy leather furniture ?
In which would the books be ordered by color , and what would that say about the person who organized them that way ?
Which would have more antlers and dark throws ?
If these have fairly easy answers , it 's because we 're in the realm of stereotype .
The uncharitable term for a writer who channels stereotypes without some measure of ironic distance is "hack . "
<START:organization> Curbed National <END> writers have used these terms before .
<START:organization> Curbed National <END> writers have stopped .
A room "masculine " enough for a modern lumberjack .

The use of the words "masculine " and "feminine " to describe spaces harks back to one of the very first lessons children learn in school ; what boys do and what girls do .
This is one of those parts of culture that it 's very good to train yourself out of , or be trained out of , or never learn in the first place .
Many people across the spectrum of gender and sexuality have complicated relationships with what society seems to expect from them .
It would be cool if these people could engage in the leisurely practice of reading about furniture or interiors without having some of the shallowest of those expectations foisted upon them .
It 's important to note that femininity , by and large , is considered an additive .
In interior design , it 's translated to fresh flowers , stemware , and bed skirts .
It is ephemeral where masculinity is formidable .
It is whimsical where masculinity is utilitarian .
It is antiqued where masculinity is modern .
Lace and chintz exist only in "feminine " spaces .
If spareness and raw architecture are "masculine , " then we 're essentially saying that traditionally "feminine " decorating is frivolous .
Suddenly those who associate themselves with femininity become a little less essential and a little less relevant .
And , in the end , maybe just a little less .
Who wants to live in a world where all of that is taken for granted ?
Some might , but why would we trust those people to advise us in matters of style ?
It 's laughable in an era where the most prominent proponent of pink in the world of industrial design is a man , and the most sought-after and vilified hero-architect in the world is a woman .
Gendered design writing is lazily offensive .
But more to the point , it 's offensively lazy .
We can do better .

Turns out it 's a bit tricky to translate the bohemian-modern design blog aesthetic ( that is natural , haphazard minimalism ) into holiday cheer .
Sometimes , in fact , the results are just downright chilling .
Here now , 10 examples of minimalist holiday decor ideas that took a turn for the depressing .

Location : <START:location> West Lake Hills , Texas <END> Price : $ 6,500,000 The Skinny : Architect <START:person> Winn Wittman <END> once called the 6,100-square-foot <START:location> Soaring Wings <END> house of <START:location> West Lake Hills , Texas <END> , the project that "literally almost killed me . "
While managing the four-year construction of the home , which wrapped up in 2007 , he fell off a rock wall and broke his back .
<START:person> Wittman <END> made a full recovery , and his work payed off pretty quickly , when the house sold just three months after completion .
" Our plan was to build our own home , " one of the buyers told <START:organization> Architectural Record <END> , " but when I walked in this one I felt spiritually connected to it instantly .
The quality and the craftsmanship are so high , and so specific , it seemed absurd that it was a spec house . "
Located just a short drive from downtown <START:location> Austin <END> , the home is connected to the locale by 45,000 pounds of red iron and 17,000 pounds of locally quarried shellstone .
( Other materials include pink <START:location> Arizona <END> sandstone , ipe wood , hand-seamed copper panels , and a " special concrete mixed with orange slice candy and gummi bears . " )

<START:location> HONG KONG <END> — At least one thing caught the eye of <START:location> China’s <END> Internet czar during his trip to the <START:location> United States <END> last week : a book written by and about the president of <START:location> China <END> on the desk of <START:person> Mark Zuckerberg <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg <END> , the chief executive of <START:organization> Facebook <END> , pointed to the book , “ <START:person> Xi Jinping <END> : The Governance of <START:organization> China <END> ” last week while giving a tour of the company ’s office to <START:person> Lu Wei <END> , the de facto head of Internet policy in <START:location> China <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Lu <END> laughed when he saw the book , an anthology of speeches and comments by <START:person> President Xi <END> .
He then asked to sit down at <START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg’s <END> desk to have a closer look , according to an account published on a Chinese state-run website .
The interaction was confirmed by a person close to the traveling group who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private .
<START:organization> Facebook <END> is typically blocked in <START:location> China <END>  .
<START:person> Mr. Lu <END> , as <START:location> China’s <END> new Internet czar , holds the key for American Internet companies to the enormous Chinese market .
He is also the ambassador of an assertive new policy in which <START:location> China <END> claims the right to block websites , censor content and track users within its borders .
One photo taken of the <START:organization> Facebook <END> visit and posted on a site associated with <START:location> China’s <END> <START:organization> State Council Information office <END> shows <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> smiling as he looks down at the book .
Sporting a white cover with a painted image of <START:person> Mr. Xi’s <END> bust reminiscent of the famed portrait of <START:person> Mao Zedong <END> that hangs in <START:location> Tiananmen Square <END> , the text offered <START:person> Mr. Lu, <END> a longtime propagandist who rose through the ranks of <START:location> China’s <END> state-run <START:organization> Xinhua News Agency <END> , an easy conversation piece .
The book runs to 515 pages in English .
With the exception of a generous number of photos depicting Mr. Xi throughout his life , it might make tough reading , even for <START:organization> Communist Party <END> stalwarts .
<START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg <END> said he had bought the book for himself and co-workers to ensure that they “understood socialism with Chinese characteristics . ”
The book might give some <START:organization> Facebook <END> users pause , since the text includes a speech by <START:person> Mr. Xi <END> in which he says <START:location> Beijing <END> should “use Internet communication rules to advocate things wholesome and positive , and disseminate and put into practice the core socialist values , ” and “should properly handle timing , extent and efficiency to make our cyberspace wholesome and clean . ”
He also says , “It is a long-term task to ensure that online public opinion is healthy and sound . ”
The visit to <START:organization> Facebook <END> was part of a whirlwind tour in the <START:location> United States <END> for <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> , a trip that offered the contrast of coasts .
In <START:location> Washington <END> , <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> faced strong criticism from American officials over Chinese hacking attacks and skepticism about his vision for Internet governance .
On the <START:location> West Coast <END> , though , he received a warmer welcome from technology executives , including <START:person> Jeff Bezos <END> , chief executive of <START:organization> Amazon <END> , and <START:person> Timothy D. Cook <END> , the head of <START:organization> Apple. <END>
<START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> trip was followed closely in the Chinese news media ; in one broadcast on the <START:location> Hong Kong <END> -based <START:organization> Phoenix Television <END> , <START:organization> eBay’s <END> chief executive , <START:person> John Donahoe <END> , was shown discussing how crucial Chinese merchants were to the company .
Responding to reports of <START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg’s <END> meeting and his reference to <START:person> Mr. Xi’s <END> book , <START:person> Hu Jia <END> , a Chinese activist , said on Monday in a <START:organization> Twitter <END> post that <START:organization> Facebook <END> was “ risking repeating the mistakes of <START:organization> Yahoo <END> ” by becoming too close to the <START:organization> Chinese government <END> .
In 2004 , the Chinese journalist <START:person> Shi Tao <END> was arrested by Chinese officials after <START:organization> Yahoo <END> provided information about his account to the government .
The episode prompted <START:organization> Yahoo's <END> co-founder , <START:person> Jerry Yang <END> , to apologize to <START:person> Mr. Shi’s <END> family .
<START:person> Mr. Shi <END> served a prison sentence from 2005 to 2013 .
<START:organization> Facebook <END> did not respond to an email seeking comment on <START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> visit to the company .
The Chinese Internet market is huge .
A recent report by the research company <START:organization> IDC <END> projected that with more than 680 million people expected to be online in <START:location> China <END> next year , its market will account for 43 percent of worldwide growth in the technology sector .
That makes it an increasingly important place to be for American companies .
But strict barriers and regulations in <START:location> China <END>  keep many of them at arm’s length .
<START:organization> Linked In <END> , the professional social network , has decided to censor some content on its Chinese site .
<START:organization> Apple <END> has agreed to host some data within <START:location> China’s <END> borders , where Chinese officials could potentially gain access to it , and this year it put out a job advertisement for a head of law enforcement in the country .
The job posting read in part : “The role will be directly responsible for the management , handling and issuance of appropriate responses to requests from law enforcement authorities , public prosecutors and courts etc . throughout <START:location> China <END> . ”
During <START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> visit in <START:location> Washington <END> , he met with members of the <START:organization> National Security Council <END> , who criticized continuing hackings against American companies and <START:location> China’s <END> top-down , government-led approach to managing the Internet , according to a senior American administration official who spoke on the condition that he not be named because the meetings were confidential .
The disagreement between the United States and <START:location> China <END> on such critical issues may provide one answer to why Mr. Lu gave equal emphasis to the <START:location> East Coast <END> and <START:location> West Coast <END> on his trip to the <START:location> United States. <END>
Meeting with <START:location> United States <END> technology companies provided <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> with ample photo opportunities to show off back home .
It also demonstrated that he could easily find eager partners in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , even as officials in <START:location> Washington <END> seek to play hardball .
<START:person> Jane Perlez <END> contributed reporting .

<START:person> Loc Tran <END> is a big man on campus at <START:organization> San Jose State University <END> in <START:location> Northern California <END> .
“A lot of people stop me when I’m walking , ” said <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> , a 19-year-old sophomore , who speaks in quick and confident bursts .
“They congratulate me . ”
But <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> is not a star on the football team , or a leader in student government .
He is a top player on the school’s competitive video game team , helping <START:organization> San Jose State <END> claw its way to victory in June over <START:organization> California State University , Fullerton <END> , in a tournament watched online by nearly 90,000 people .
When the new school year started this fall , classmates ’ heads swiveled toward him when professors said his name during roll call .
“ I thought that was pretty cool , ” <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> said .
Video game competitions , also known as e-sports , have taken off on campuses across the country , including <START:organization> Harvard <END> and <START:organization> Florida State University <END> .
More than 10,000 students now play in the biggest college league , 4,400 more than last year and 4,600 more than the number of men who play on Division I college basketball teams .
The stakes keep climbing , too : Winning a big tournament can sometimes earn players several years ’ worth of tuition money .
And in a possible sign of the future , the athletic department of <START:organization> Robert Morris University Illinois <END> in <START:location> Chicago <END> created an official video game team this fall , offering the same sort of scholarships given to athletes playing soccer , football and ice hockey .
While the college e-sports craze started as a grass-roots effort , game makers have quickly swooped in , propelling the sharp rise in interest .
The companies now underwrite scholarship prizes , offer team banners and provide organizational support , sensing a possible breeding ground for a new generation of superfans — people who not only play games but also consider them a spectator sport .
“Game developers are really waking up to the publicity power of these communities , ” said <START:person> T. L. Taylor <END> , an associate professor of comparative media studies at the <START:organization> Massachusetts Institute of Technology <END> , who has studied e-sports .
Colleges , meanwhile , are often standing at arm’s length .
While e-sports groups are often sanctioned clubs , receiving practice spaces from their schools , the leagues and competitions have few of the student regulations governing traditional college sports , like grade-point minimums or time limits on practicing .
The rise in e-sports has been so abrupt , many schools have not determined what to make of it .
<START:person> Carter Henderson <END> , a spokesman for the <START:organization> University of Washington’s <END> athletics program , said no one from the department was familiar enough with e-sports to discuss the topic .
The <START:organization> National Collegiate Athletic Association <END> , which oversees college athletics , said it had no comment about e-sports on campus .
Game companies say it is too early to predict how university administrations will become involved in e-sports .
“This is just how basketball was in the 1940s , ” said <START:person> Christopher Wyatt <END> , senior manager for North American publishing at <START:organization> Riot Games <END> .
“A lot of the structure and organization you see in more formal athletics , that groundwork is still being laid down here . ”
But it is unclear whether becoming a more formal part of a school would help or harm the growth of college e-sports .
The time commitment required for serious competitive gaming could lead to concerns about whether e-sports leave enough time for academic study .
In addition , formal recognition could diminish the autonomy that companies and teams have on campuses , bringing about rules like Title IX , the gender equity law .
About the possibility of more official recognition , <START:person> Dr. Taylor <END> said , “ I don’t think collegiate e-sports players are unified in any way that this is a good thing . ”
For game developers , however , the lure of being on campus is simple .
“We think that ’s where a lot of our players are , ” said <START:person> Michael Morhaime <END> , the chief executive and co-founder of <START:organization> Blizzard Entertainment <END> , which develops and publishes entertainment software .
In September , <START:organization> Blizzard <END> flew eight finalists from the <START:organization> College of Staten Island <END> , <START:organization> University of Massachusetts-Amherst <END> and other colleges to <START:location> Seattle <END> to compete for $ 5,000 in scholarship money in a tournament of <START:organization> Hearthstone <END> , a virtual card game from the company .
Last year , <START:organization> Azubu <END> , a games media company , sponsored a competition that awarded $ 40,000 in prize money to six students on a StarCraft II team from the <START:organization> University of California , Berkeley <END> .
Last February , <START:organization> Riot Games <END> hosted its first North American Collegiate Championship , something like the Final Four for <START:organization> League of Legends <END> , <START:organization> Riot’s <END> popular online battle game .
A team of five students from the <START:organization> University of Washington <END> won in front of a roaring audience at an e-sports studio that <START:organization> Riot <END> operates in <START:location> Manhattan Beach , Calif. <END> , with 169,000 more people watching online at the tournament’s peak .
The prize was $ 7,500 in scholarship money for each team member .
Riot recently announced that first-place winnings at the next championship , to be held in the spring , would rise to $ 30,000 , enough to pay for about three years of in-state tuition at the <START:organization> University of Washington. <END>
“A lot more people than I expected came forward and said , ‘I’d like to try out for the team , ’ ” said <START:person> Jackson Brown <END> , the manager of the <START:organization> University of Washington’s <END> team , the <START:organization> Purple Caster Minions <END> .
The growth of competitive gaming at colleges mirrors the broader rise of e-sports as entertainment .
A thriving international professional e-sports circuit routinely draws tens of thousands of spectators to stadiums for competitions , with millions more viewers online .
Top prizes for some events are now in the millions of dollars .
<START:organization> Twitch <END> , a video streaming service that made its name broadcasting e-sport matches , was acquired this year for close to $ 1 billion by <START:organization> Amazon <END> .
The college scene is largely organized around the <START:organization> Collegiate StarLeague <END> , which started at <START:organization> Princeton <END> in 2009 and is the biggest college league .
The organization is now active at 450 schools , up from 260 last year , according to <START:person> Duran Parsi <END> , the head of the league .
Many of those players also participate in matches organized by another collegiate league , <START:organization> IvyLoL <END> .
Large <START:location> West Coast <END> schools like the <START:organization> University of Washington <END> and <START:organization> University of British Columbia <END> tend to dominate the competitions .
The money that game companies are pouring into the college scene has persuaded many students to become much more serious about e-sports .
College scholarships from corporations , including <START:organization> Coca-Cola, <END> <START:organization> Ford <END> and <START:organization> Google <END> , have been around for decades , usually to encourage students to enter a particular field , like engineering .
The money that game companies are giving to students , in contrast , is meant to deepen the companies ’ relationship with a whole generation of players , one that is inseparable from their products .
Today , most professional players skip or delay college , because the college-age years are considered the prime period for players in the big leagues .
Playing at the professional level requires far too much time for practice and travel to tournaments to allow them to also attend school .
<START:person> Conan Liu <END> , a student at <START:organization> Berkeley <END> , took a year off from school to play StarCraft II professionally after his school team won the <START:organization> Azubu <END> championship .
<START:person> Mr. Liu <END> returned to school this fall to focus on pre-med studies because he did not perform as well as he had hoped in the pros .
While even bench warmers in the <START:organization> National Basketball Association <END> make more than $ 500,000 a year , the same is not true of professional gamers .
“You have to really be at the top , top to make a nice living , ” <START:person> Mr. Liu <END> said .
Game companies and collegiate league organizers predict that college e-sports could become a pipeline for the growing professional circuit .
Game companies say they are awarding scholarship money at college tournaments , rather than unrestricted cash prizes , to give students an incentive to continue their studies .
“We really want e-sports to become as ingrained in the academic environment as anything else — speech competitions , football competitions , ” said <START:person> Tyler Rosen <END> , president of the <START:organization> e-Sports Association <END> , which helps organize college events with the financial support of <START:organization> Blizzard Entertainment <END> .
A test of what happens when schools embrace e-sports started recently at <START:organization> Robert Morris University Illinois <END> .
The first 35 students to receive athletic scholarships under the school’s new e-sports program began training this fall in a room decked out with jet-black walls , mood lighting and leather gamer chairs with red piping .
The students , all <START:organization> League of Legends <END> players , are getting up to 50 percent of the price of tuition and room and board , which runs about $ 39,000 a year , according to <START:person> Kurt Melcher <END> , the university’s associate athletic director .
<START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> said he had received more than half a dozen calls from athletic directors at other universities who are interested in incorporating e-sports into their programs .
The idea came to <START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> , a gamer , this year after he started reading about the <START:organization> Collegiate StarLeague <END> .
A conversation with his wife dispelled any doubts he had about awarding athletic scholarships to gamers .
<START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> said his wife asked , “ Why should it only be given to some kid who can put a ball into a hole ? ”

<START:location> PARIS <END> — Europe wants to cash in on its tough data protection rules .
<START:organization> European Union <END> policy makers are demanding greater controls over how companies like <START:organization> Google <END> and <START:organization> Facebook <END> use personal information .
At the same time , others would like to use those same laws to help European companies compete against their American rivals as a way to jump-start a sluggish economy .
That debate over how best to leverage the regulations was on show during a meeting here on Monday , as local privacy regulators gathered to discuss the growing public outcry over how governments and tech giants gather and use people’s data .
That outcry has resulted from disclosures by <START:person> Edward J. Snowden <END> , the former <START:organization> National Security Agency <END> contractor , about the activities of the American and British intelligence services , as well as the expanding use of people’s information by Internet companies like <START:organization> Microsoft <END> and <START:organization> Amazon <END> .
‘‘ We feel we are losing control over our data , ’’ said <START:person> Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin <END> , who heads the French data protection authority .
‘‘Data protection is at a crossroads , and it ’s important that Europe speaks with one voice .’’
Europe is now completing a new round of privacy rules , expected to be made final next year , that will give greater power to individuals over who has access to their data and how it is used .
European policy makers are also considering fines of up to 5 percent of a company ’s annual revenue , or $ 125 million , whichever is greater , when the strict privacy rules are breached .
While regulators are pressing ahead with even tougher data protection rules , some of Europe’s lawmakers are eager to allow homegrown companies to use the rules governing the growing amount of personal information online as a defense against the American tech giants that currently dominate the region’s Internet economy .
In <START:location> Germany <END> , for example , policy makers and tech companies have created made-in-Germany email and cloud services — which allow people to store information on the Internet instead of on their own hard drives — that comply with the country ’s tough data protection rules .
And companies in <START:location> Finland <END> and <START:location> France <END> are pushing their own rival services , which are based on <START:location> Europe’s <END> stricter privacy rules , in the hope of enticing users to switch from American Internet giants to local competitors .
‘‘ <START:location> Europe <END> must turn data protection into a competitive advantage , ’’ <START:person> Manuel Valls <END> , the French prime minister , said at the meeting here on Monday .
‘‘It’s difficult to accept that European citizens have their data siphoned off by other countries without their knowledge .’’
Critics warn , however , that <START:location> Europe <END> must also beef up its oversight of all technology companies as they are increasingly scraping individual data for commercial use .
Currently , each of the <START:organization> European Union’s <END> 28 members has a separate data protection authority that oversees the activities of companies in its jurisdiction .
Campaigners say that these domestic regulators have yet to assess hefty fines on Internet companies for the potential abuse of people’s online data , and that the system must be revamped to keep up with how companies , either European or those from outside the union , are using online information .
‘‘The system we have now is n’t working , ’’ said <START:person> Max Schrems <END> , an Austrian lawyer who has brought a class-action lawsuit against <START:organization> Facebook <END> that accuses the company of misusing personal data .
‘‘If you park in the wrong place , you get a parking ticket .
But if a company violates the privacy rights of millions of people , nothing happens .’’

<START:organization> Google <END> , like many tech companies , is a man’s world .
Started by a pair of men , its executive team is overwhelmingly male , and its work force is dominated by men .
Over all , seven out of 10 people who work at <START:organization> Google <END> are male .
Men make up 83 percent of <START:organization> Google’s <END> engineering employees and 79 percent of its managers .
In a report to the <START:organization> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission <END> last year , <START:organization> Google <END> said that of its 36 executives and top-ranking managers , just three are women .
<START:organization> Google’s <END> leaders say they are unhappy about the firm’s poor gender diversity , and about the severe underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics among its work force .
And so they are undertaking a long-term effort to improve these numbers , the centerpiece of which is a series of workshops aimed at making <START:organization> Google <END> ’s culture more accepting of diversity .
There’s just one problem : The company has no solid evidence that the workshops , or many of its other efforts to improve diversity , are actually working .
In some ways <START:organization> Google’s <END> plan to fix its diversity issues resembles many of its most ambitious product ideas , from self-driving cars to wiring the country for superfast Internet .
As in those efforts , it has set a high goal in this case : to fight deep-set cultural biases and an insidious frat-house attitude that pervades the tech business .
Tech luminaries make sexist comments so often that it has ceased to be news when they do .
<START:organization> Google <END> is attacking the problem with its considerable resources and creativity .
But it does not have a timeline for when the company ’s work force might become representative of the population , or whether it will ever get there .
“ I think it ’s terrific that they’re doing this , ” said <START:person> Freada Kapor Klein <END> , an entrepreneur who has long studied workplace diversity , and who is the co-chairwoman of the <START:organization> Kapor Center for Social Impact <END> .
“ But it ’s going to be important that <START:organization> Google <END> not just give a lecture about the science , but that there be active strategies on how to mitigate bias .
A one-shot intervention against a lifetime of biased messages is unlikely to be successful . ”
Google says its plan is n’t one-shot .
It points out that it has been trying to improve its diversity for years by sponsoring programs to increase the number of women and minorities who go into tech , and meticulously studying the way it hires people in an effort to reduce bias .
In May after pressure from civil rights leaders , the company published a report documenting the sex and race of its employees “to be candid about the issues , ” <START:person> Laszlo Bock <END> , <START:organization> Google’s <END> executive in charge of human resources , wrote at the time .
<START:organization> Google’s <END> disclosure prompted a wave of similar reports across the industry , with <START:organization> Facebook <END> , <START:organization> Apple <END> , <START:organization> Yahoo <END> and other tech giants issuing similarly dismal numbers about their work forces .
<START:organization> Google’s <END> diversity training workshops , which began last year and which more than half of <START:organization> Google <END> ’s nearly 49,000 employees have attended , are based on an emerging field of research in social psychology known as unconscious bias .
These are the hidden , reflexive preferences that shape most people’s worldviews , and that can profoundly affect how welcoming and open a workplace is to different people and ideas .
<START:organization> Google’s <END> interest in hidden biases was sparked in 2012 , when <START:person> Mr. Bock <END> read an article in <START:organization> The New York Times <END> about a study that showed systematic discrimination against female applicants for scientific jobs in academia .
The effect was so pervasive that researchers theorized the discrimination must be governed by unconscious cultural biases rather than overt sexism .
<START:person> Mr. Bock <END> wondered how such unconscious biases were playing out at <START:organization> Google <END> .
“This is a pretty genteel environment , and you don’t usually see outright manifestations of bias , ” he said .
“Occasionally you’ll have some idiot do something stupid and hurtful , and I like to fire those people . ”
But <START:person> Mr. Bock <END> suspected that the more pernicious bias was most likely pervasive and hidden , a deep-set part of the culture rather than the work of a few loudmouth sexists .
Improving diversity was n’t just a feel-good goal for <START:organization> Google <END> .
Citing research that shows diverse teams can be more creative than homogeneous ones , <START:person> Mr. Bock <END> argued that a diverse work force could be good for <START:organization> Google’s <END> business .
Could <START:organization> Google <END> investigate how biases were affecting people’s work — and , more important , could it change its own culture ?
Google’s human resources group , which goes by the name People Operations , functions like a graduate school research lab , with staff scientists who are constantly analyzing the company ’s internal operations .
<START:person> Mr. Bock <END> asked one of these researchers , <START:person> Brian Welle <END> , to begin a project on hidden biases .
After a few months , <START:person> Dr. Welle <END> came up with a 90-minute lecture targeted specifically at a skeptical , scientifically minded <START:organization> Google <END> employee .
The lecture begins with a dismal fact : Everyone is a little bit racist or sexist .
If you think you’re immune , take the Implicit Association Test , which empirically measures people’s biases .
<START:person> Dr. Welle <END> goes on to explain that some of the most damaging bias is unconscious ; people do the worst stuff without meaning to , or even recognizing that they’re being influenced by their preferences .
The effect of bias is powerful , and it is n’t softened by <START:location> Silicon Valley’s <END> supposedly meritocratic culture .
In the lecture , <START:person> Dr. Welle <END> shows a computer simulation of how a systematic 1 percent bias against women in performance evaluation scores can trickle up through the ranks , leading to a severe underrepresentation of women in management .
Finally , <START:person> Dr. Welle <END> points to research showing that we aren’t slaves to our hidden biases .
The more we make ourselves aware of the role our unconscious plays in our decision-making , and the more we try to force others to confront their biases , the greater the chance we have of overcoming our hidden preferences .
<START:organization> Google <END> offered several anecdotes that seem to indicate a less biased culture as a result of the training .
Not long ago the company opened a new building , and someone spotted the fact that all the conference rooms were named after male scientists ; in the past , that might have gone unmentioned , but this time the names were changed .
During one recent promotion meeting in which a group of male managers were deciding the fate of a female engineer , a senior manager who had been through the bias training cautioned his colleagues to remember that they were all men — and thus might not be able to fully appreciate the different roles women perform in engineering groups .
“ Just raising the awareness was enough for people to think about it , ” <START:person> Mr. Bock <END> said .
The woman was promoted .
Another time , in an all-company presentation , an interviewer asked a male and female manager who had recently begun sharing an office , “ Which one of you does the dishes ? ”
The strange , sexist undertone of the question was immediately seized upon by a senior executive in the crowd , who yelled , “ Unconscious bias ! ”
<START:person> Mr. Bock <END> saw all of these actions as evidence that the training was working .
“Suddenly you go from being completely oblivious to going , ‘Oh my god , it ’s everywhere , ’ ” he said .
But whether that will lead to a long-term change at <START:organization> Google <END> and , in turn , the rest of the tech industry , remains an open question .

<START:location> MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif <END> .
— LAST June , in an interview with Adam Bryant of The Times , <START:person> Laszlo Bock <END> , the senior vice president of people operations for <START:organization> Google <END> — i .e . , the guy in charge of hiring for one of the world’s most successful companies — noted that <START:organization> Google <END> had determined that “G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring , and test scores are worthless .
... We found that they don’t predict anything . ”
He also noted that the “proportion of people without any college education at <START:organization> Google <END> has increased over time ” — now as high as 14 percent on some teams .
At a time when many people are asking , “How’s my kid gonna get a job ? ”
I thought it would be useful to visit <START:organization> Google <END> and hear how <START:person> Bock <END> would answer .
Don’t get him wrong , <START:person> Bock <END> begins , “Good grades certainly don’t hurt . ”
Many jobs at <START:organization> Google <END> require math , computing and coding skills , so if your good grades truly reflect skills in those areas that you can apply , it would be an advantage .
But <START:organization> Google <END> has its eyes on much more .
“There are five hiring attributes we have across the company , ” explained <START:person> Bock <END> .
“If it ’s a technical role , we assess your coding ability , and half the roles in the company are technical roles .
For every job , though , the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability , and it ’s not I.Q .
It’s learning ability .
It’s the ability to process on the fly .
It’s the ability to pull together disparate bits of information .
We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they’re predictive . ”
The second , he added , “is leadership — in particular emergent leadership as opposed to traditional leadership .
Traditional leadership is , were you president of the chess club ?
Were you vice president of sales ?
How quickly did you get there ?
We don’t care .
What we care about is , when faced with a problem and you’re a member of a team , do you , at the appropriate time , step in and lead .
And just as critically , do you step back and stop leading , do you let someone else ?
Because what’s critical to be an effective leader in this environment is you have to be willing to relinquish power . ”
What else ? Humility and ownership .
“It’s feeling the sense of responsibility , the sense of ownership , to step in , ” he said , to try to solve any problem — and the humility to step back and embrace the better ideas of others .
“Your end goal , ” explained <START:person> Bock <END> , “is what can we do together to problem-solve .
I’ve contributed my piece , and then I step back . ”
And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute , says <START:person> Bock <END> , it ’s “intellectual humility .
Without humility , you are unable to learn . ”
It is why research shows that many graduates from hotshot business schools plateau .
“Successful bright people rarely experience failure , and so they don’t learn how to learn from that failure , ” said <START:person> Bock <END> .
“They , instead , commit the fundamental attribution error , which is if something good happens , it ’s because I’m a genius .
If something bad happens , it ’s because someone’s an idiot or I did n’t get the resources or the market moved .
... What we’ve seen is that the people who are the most successful here , who we want to hire , will have a fierce position .
They’ll argue like hell .
They’ll be zealots about their point of view .
But then you say , ‘here’s a new fact , ’ and they’ll go , ‘ Oh , well , that changes things ; you’re right . ’
” You need a big ego and small ego in the same person at the same time .
The least important attribute they look for is “expertise . ”
Said <START:person> Bock <END> : “If you take somebody who has high cognitive ability , is innately curious , willing to learn and has emergent leadership skills , and you hire them as an H.R. person or finance person , and they have no content knowledge , and you compare them with someone who’s been doing just one thing and is a world expert , the expert will go : ‘I’ve seen this 100 times before ; here ’s what you do . ’ ” Most of the time the nonexpert will come up with the same answer , added <START:person> Bock <END> , “because most of the time it ’s not that hard . ”
Sure , once in a while they will mess it up , he said , but once in a while they’ll also come up with an answer that is totally new .
And there is huge value in that .
To sum up <START:person> Bock’s <END> approach to hiring : Talent can come in so many different forms and be built in so many nontraditional ways today , hiring officers have to be alive to every one — besides brand-name colleges .
Because “when you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world , those are exceptional human beings .
And we should do everything we can to find those people . ”
Too many colleges , he added , “don’t deliver on what they promise .
You generate a ton of debt , you don’t learn the most useful things for your life .
It’s [just ] an extended adolescence . ”
<START:organization> Google <END> attracts so much talent it can afford to look beyond traditional metrics , like G.P.A.
For most young people , though , going to college and doing well is still the best way to master the tools needed for many careers .
But <START:person> Bock <END> is saying something important to them , too : Beware .
Your degree is not a proxy for your ability to do any job .
The world only cares about — and pays off on — what you can do with what you know ( and it does n’t care how you learned it ) .
And in an age when innovation is increasingly a group endeavor , it also cares about a lot of soft skills — leadership , humility , collaboration , adaptability and loving to learn and re-learn .
This will be true no matter where you go to work .

Once upon a time , a new technology happened along .
It was called radio .
Soon enough , some people began plucking wireless transmissions out of the air for their own purposes .
One clever young man in <START:location> Washington <END> figured out how to intercept messages that <START:organization> Navy <END> units sent to one another .
“ He has represented himself to be at distant naval stations or at sea on warships equipped with wireless apparatus , ” a magazine called <START:organization> Electrical World <END> reported in 1907 .
Back then , this fellow’s actions were not unlawful .
They amounted nonetheless to a form of piracy .
As radio grew more sophisticated , so did those intent on beating the system .
In 1960s <START:location> Britain <END> , radio pirates flourished on unlicensed stations that broadcast from ships anchored beyond territorial limits .
They found eager audiences in young people who tuned in for the latest from the <START:organization> Rolling Stones <END> , <START:organization> the Kinks <END> and <START:organization> the Who <END> .
( Talkin’ ′bout my generation . )
Then the world went digital .
Naturally , pirates tagged along .
One of them , the online sharing service <START:organization> Napster <END> , forms the core of this <START:organization> Retro Report <END> offering , the final installment in the current series of video documentaries examining the consequences of major news stories from the past .
<START:organization> Napster <END> did not last long , two years .
But for a while at the dawn of this century it claimed to have 70 million registered users .
It spawned a host of Internet music-swapping providers , more than a few of them falling on the dubious side of the law .
Most important , it irrevocably altered not only the way in which Americans absorbed music but also their belief system in what they should pay .
The conviction theologically held by many boiled down to a single word : nothing .
“You have a generation of people now who expect their music for free , ” <START:person> Greg Hammer <END> , managing director of <START:organization> Red Bull Records <END> , a branch of the energy-drink company , told <START:organization> Retro Report <END> .
“It’s very difficult to change . ”
The music industry is not alone in coming to terms with altered realities .
As every sentient soul surely knows by now , the “culture of free” — words borrowed from the title of this week’s video — has turned the print world upside down , pushing newspapers , magazines and book publishers into a frantic search for financial safe harbors .
With the advent of broad Internet use in the 1990s came a notion that information should be free .
Never mind that the gathering and transmission of information can be a costly proposition and that ( dirty word alert ) money is needed if the survival of , say , a newspaper is to be ensured .
As with music in <START:person> Mr. Hammer’s <END> observation , a generation now believes that the written word , whether on processed wood or in pixels , should come without charge .
<START:organization> Napster <END> burst forth in June 1999 , the brainchild of an entrepreneurial , 18-year-old computer wiz , <START:person> Shawn Fanning <END> .
His creation enabled anyone with a modicum of tech savvy to share audio files in MP3 format — peer to peer , as it was called .
Music lovers could download thousands upon thousands of songs , then pass them on to friends or create albums of their own on compact discs .
No one paid royalties .
To music companies and some individual artists , this was high-tech piracy and a threat to their fiscal well-being .
( It might be noted that the commercial introduction of CDs in the early 1980s delivered its own near-mortal blow to an earlier technology , long-playing vinyl records . )
The <START:organization> Recording Industry Association of America <END> sued <START:organization> Napster <END> for copyright infringement .
So did a few musicians , like the rapper Dr. Dre and the heavy metal band <START:organization> Metallica <END> .
Not every performer thought of <START:organization> Napster <END> as the enemy .
Some who might otherwise have been doomed to oblivion regarded the service as a platform from which they might find listeners and build a fan base .
Nor were all economists convinced that one free download equaled one less sale of a high-priced CD ; quite possibly , some of them said , people were plugging into music that they would never have paid for .
<START:organization> Napster <END> , however , did not have the courts on its side .
Ordered by federal judges to stop allowing copyrighted material to be traded on its system , it shut down in July 2001 .
But from its ashes other file-sharing services arose , some bearing curious names like <START:organization> Grokster <END> , <START:organization> Kazaa <END> and <START:organization> Gnutella <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Fanning <END> tried his hand at new digital media endeavors , including Snocap and <START:organization> Napster <END> 2.0.
Few of those companies were unqualified successes .
One thing was certain , though : The culture of free was not going away .
A decade ago , <START:organization> Apple <END> established a new order in the commercial music universe by introducing the <START:organization> iTunes <END> store .
From its vast digital warehouse , customers could buy any song they wished , typically for 99 cents .
The arrangement was perhaps not ideal for the recording companies and for many performers .
Among other things , music albums — fixtures since the ’60s and , in many instances , creative masterpieces — were becoming relics ; single-song listening ruled , whether through an iTunes purchase or snatched from the ether via file-swapping networks .
Still , for the industry , some money was better than none , and so an <START:organization> iTunes <END> reality beat a <START:organization> Napster <END> world .
Now the music business is in transition once more , reshaped by streaming services like <START:organization> YouTube <END> , Spotify and <START:organization> Pandora <END> .
Instead of owning songs , a listener can in effect borrow them from millions of titles made available by these operations .
A cultural shift seems well underway , with more and more consumers sensing they no longer need to possess certain physical items , like CDs or books .
A reliable Internet connection will do .
Unlike <START:organization> Napster <END> and the like , the streaming services are not engaged in piracy .
They are legally licensed , having paid music companies some money .
They themselves cash in by selling advertising or , increasingly , by offering subscriptions to customers interested in a commercial-free experience .
The results have been stark .
Data from <START:organization> Nielsen SoundScan <END> , a sales-tracking system , show that consumers in this country listened to 70 billion songs via streaming services in the first half of 2014 , an increase of 42 percent from the same period a year earlier .
Sales of albums , whether on CDs or through digital downloads , declined by 15 percent .
Downloads of individual tracks were down by 13 percent .
Embrace the change , <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> types say .
But even if one does , it comes at a cost .
As CDs fade from the scene , so do stores like <START:organization> Tower Records <END> .
Thousands of jobs are lost : workers who make the discs , wholesale buyers , salespeople , stockroom clerks , accountants and others .
Substitute work for them is not assured in the digital cosmos .
And , thus far , the people who create the music on which others build their fortunes often receive mere rivulets of reward .
Not everyone is a <START:person> Beyoncé <END> or a <START:person> Taylor Swift <END> ( who has removed her entire oeuvre from <START:organization> Spotify <END> to keep it behind a pay wall ) .
Many more musicians are like <START:person> Zoe Keating <END> , a cellist from <START:location> Northern California <END> who described her situation in detail last year .
Over a six-month period , <START:person> Ms. Keating’s <END> songs had been played on <START:organization> Pandora <END> more than 1.5 million times ; that earned her all of $ 1,652.74 .
She had 131,000 plays on <START:organization> Spotify <END> in 2012 .
She took home $ 547.71 , or less than half a penny per play .
Some industry executives insist that , over time , things will sort themselves out , including how to steer more money to performers .
Last month , for instance , <START:organization> YouTube <END> announced plans to generate revenue by giving its users an opportunity to pay a few dollars a month in return for extra features that are not available to those who click on songs at no charge .
Royalties to artists , in theory anyway , would thus rise .
In the meantime , some oldsters ( talkin’ ′bout my generation again ) may derive a measure of comfort from learning that vinyl albums still have life .
<START:organization> Nielsen SoundScan <END> reported four million sales of vinyl LPs in the first half of this year , a 40 percent increase from the same period in 2013 .
Go figure .
Hey , maybe you can get a copy of “Revolution 9” from the <START:organization> Beatles <END> ’ White Album , and check out for yourself if , when played backward on a turntable , it really does tell you that <START:person> Paul <END> is dead .

Until last year , when she became a planning consultant for a college in <START:location> Florida <END> , <START:person> Alison Barlow <END> traveled almost full time for an information technology company .
She was away as long as three weeks a month , making it home on weekends about half the time .
When a hotel stay at a <START:organization> Hampton Inn <END> in suburban <START:location> Omaha <END> was punctuated by a bout of flu , the staff made drugstore runs and brought her tea and crackers .
Knowing she would return soon , she would leave a bag behind with toiletries , workout wear and extra clothes .
“You don’t want to check luggage on an airplane , ” she said .
While staying at a <START:organization> Candlewood Suites <END> , she borrowed books and DVDs .
As hotels continue to add all manner of fees and executives look over their shoulders at <START:organization> Airbnb <END> and the sharing economy , they are increasingly telling guests to pack light and borrow items from them .
While loan programs are an accepted feature at luxury and full-service hotels , experts say that those hotels are now expanding their offerings to include bicycles , automobiles and running gear .
And hotels on a lower tier , like <START:organization> Candlewood Suites <END> , are starting their own programs .
“It’s reached all the way down from luxury to full-service hotels , and it ’s not unusual for select service , ” says <START:person> Bjorn Hanson <END> , professor at the <START:organization> Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism <END> at <START:organization> New York University <END> .
Some programs — like <START:organization> Kimpton Hotels <END> ’ Forgot It ? We’ve Got It ! — have been available for a decade .
They are drawing renewed attention because younger travelers are responding to hotels ’ attempts to create a relationship by going out of their way for guests .
<START:person> Bonnie Knutson <END> , a professor at <START:organization> Michigan State University’s <END> <START:organization> School of Hospitality Business <END> , said she saw an emphasis on choice , personalization and customization .
“Guests are saying , ‘ I only want to pay for what I want to use , ' ” she said .
The <START:organization> Kimpton <END> program offers a variety of small items and appliances , including chargers , hair dryers , extension cords and curling irons .
<START:organization> Hyatt Has It <END> was introduced in February 2013 with similar offerings .
“Before , travelers thought we did n’t offer any product other than a toothbrush , ” says <START:person> Kristine Rose <END> , vice president for brand experience at <START:organization> Hyatt <END> .
The program is aimed at the female traveler .
“Women tend to travel with a lot more things in their luggage , ” she said .
The program is offered under different names at all <START:organization> Hyatt <END> brands .
In addition to lending books and DVDs , <START:organization> Candlewood Suites <END> , an extended-stay division of the <START:organization> InterContinental Hotels Group <END> , introduced a <START:organization> Lending Locker <END> in 300 hotels in October 2013 .
The floor-to-ceiling enclosure provides items not typically found in guest rooms including fans , crockpots , dehumidifiers and office supplies .
<START:person> Robert Radomski <END> , vice president for brand management at <START:organization> I.H.G. <END> 's extended-stay brands , which include <START:organization> Candlewood Suites <END> , says the program creates a feeling of belonging for guests .
“It adds to their comfort , ” he said .
Some programs emphasize fitness .
<START:organization> Westin Hotels <END> introduced a Westin-New Balance equipment-lending program at more than 200 hotels in November 2012 .
The company estimates 30,000 guests a year participate .
<START:person> Peter Shankman <END> , an entrepreneur and author of the coming book “Zombie Loyalists ” was one .
Fourteen months ago , at a <START:organization> Westin <END> in <START:location> Atlanta <END> , he was up at 5 a.m. for a run before an early meeting .
After donning his shorts , he realized he forgot to pack running socks .
Expecting to run a 10-kilometer race three days later , he thought wearing dress socks for a seven-mile run that morning invited blisters .
The front desk staff offered him a free pair of running socks .
“They allowed me to continue on a schedule I preferred , which meant more to me than anything , ” he said .
Still , he has not traveled without his own equipment since .
A <START:organization> Westin <END> hotel typically charges $ 5 per stay for the socks , freshly laundered workout wear in a variety of sizes for both sexes , and sneakers that are cleaned and disinfected after each use .
The inner soles are changed monthly .
Fitness appeal takes different forms .
In July 2013 , <START:organization> Kimpton <END> , in partnership with Public , a <START:location> San Francisco <END> boutique bicycle and equipment company , introduced a fleet of Kimpton-branded bicycles that are free for guests to use .
Two to 10 bikes are available at 61 locations .
For guests who prefer four wheels , in March Loews introduced a chauffeur-driven car at five locations nationwide to take guests to nearby destinations .
Guests are responsible for their return transportation to the hotel .
At locations in <START:location> Miami <END> , <START:location> Hollywood <END> and <START:location> Santa Monica <END> , the hotels also offer free <START:organization> Fiat <END> loaner cars .
Even as loan programs can create greater loyalty and perhaps a willingness to pay a premium for a specific hotel , they have potential drawbacks , according to one expert , who sees the possibility that fewer guests will request items in the future , because of concerns about health and well-being .
“Some hotels may temporarily suspend these items as a precautionary response to protecting guest health and reducing liability , ” <START:person> Henry Harteveldt <END> , an analyst at <START:organization> Atmosphere Research Group <END> , wrote in an email .
For some guests , like <START:person> Ms. Barlow <END> , a preferred amenity is the ability to leave belongings behind .
<START:person> Mike DeFrino <END> , the chief operating officer at <START:organization> Kimpton Hotels <END> , said he had noticed at locations in <START:location> Cambridge , Mass. <END> , and <START:location> Cupertino , Calif. <END> , as many as 5 percent of guests are leaving bags behind .
“At <START:location> Cupertino <END> , they leave suits , ” he said .
“They don’t want to travel with blazers . ”
By accepting guest property for safekeeping , hotels run the risk of losing reputation and loyalty if something happens to it .
“The worst thing is to lose or misplace a guest item , ” <START:person> Mr. Hanson <END> said .
<START:person> Ms. Barlow <END> said she drew the line at leaving a laptop .
Still , even as her travel has abated , she said she missed staying long enough to establish a rapport with the hotel staff .

<START:location> SEATTLE <END> – Last week , I had a few minutes to kill so rather than blow it on <START:organization> Facebook <END> or <START:organization> Twitter <END> , I made a little cash .
I installed an app called <START:organization> Spare5 <END> on my <START:organization> iPhone <END> and , moments later , was using it to describe women’s shoes for the Internet retailer <START:organization> Zulily <END> .
After 12 minutes of tagging photos with words like “sandal” and “flats ” – and realizing how meager my insights into women’s footwear are – I prepared to see my earnings .
My payout : 26 cents or , if I had continued at that pace , $ 1.30 an hour .
Internet companies have figured out ways to help people make money by sharing their cars , renting out their apartments and performing mundane tasks like standing in line .
Now they want to give them a way monetize downtime , the brief interludes in most people’s day when they’re waiting for a latte at <START:organization> Starbucks <END> , sitting in a waiting room or riding the bus home .
It’s the next logical step in the sharing economy .
The first generation of companies in the field – <START:organization> TaskRabbit <END> , <START:organization> Lyft <END> , <START:organization> Airbnb <END> and <START:organization> Fiverr <END> – turned people into microentrepreneurs , giving them online marketplaces to profit from their skills and property and , if they hustled enough , providing real income .
<START:organization> Spare5 <END> turns them into something else – call them nanoentrepreneurs .
It is n’t a substitute for a job .
It’s a substitute for playing <START:organization> Candy Crush <END> and liking pictures of your friends ’ schnauzer on <START:organization> Facebook <END> .
Rather than spending a dollar to receive fake gold coins in a game , you can use the app to earn actual coins .
“We all have this Pavlovian response , if you’re in an elevator or have a few minutes , we all pull out our phones and do something , ” said <START:person> Matt Bencke <END> , the chief executive of <START:organization> Spare5 <END> , which plans to announce on Monday that it has raised $ 3.25 million in funding from <START:organization> Madrona Venture Group <END> , <START:organization> New Enterprise Associates <END> and the <START:organization> Foundry Group <END> .
The idea behind <START:organization> Spare5 <END> , which was formed inside <START:organization> Madrona <END> by a start-up studio at the firm , is to use that time more productively .
“You get a push notification , open it up and two minutes later , you made a buck , ” <START:person> Mr. Bencke <END> said .
“We’re very much trying to harness the attention deficit generation . ”
“We’re definitely not trying to be a job , ” he added .
Yet <START:organization> Spare5 <END> is a form of work , even if it ’s not remunerative .
<START:person> Mr. Bencke <END> calls the app an “on-demand work platform that breaks large , corporate , operational problems into tiny , bite-sized tasks . ”
In its initial form , the company ’s corporate clients are harnessing the masses to help with a problem that has no great solution today : describing big libraries of photographs so that they are more easily discoverable to people through Internet search .
Having accurate , detailed tags on photographs – also known as metadata – is becoming increasingly important to e-commerce , helping people find the right piece of apparel , a home with the appropriate décor and a hotel room with the perfect view .
Having employees do the tagging is tough when a vast number of images is involved , and it ’s notoriously difficult for computers to accurately describe the contents of photos on their own .
<START:organization> Getty Images <END> , the big creator and distributor of photographs , is starting a pilot program with <START:organization> Spare5 <END> to help improve the quality of metadata on its photographs so that the most relevant images pop up first when its customers search for them .
<START:person> Steve Heck <END> , <START:organization> Getty’s <END> chief technology officer , says the app can help with “disambiguation ” of existing metadata on photos ; clarifying , for example , whether a picture tagged “Chicago ” shows the musical , the city or the band .
The other option for companies like <START:organization> Getty <END> is to farm out their image tagging to low-wage countries like India .
<START:organization> Mr. Heck <END> said <START:organization> Getty <END> had done that , but it was challenging to train outsourcers to do the work well and then retain their workers .
<START:organization> Getty <END> has also considered using an online marketplace run by <START:organization> Amazon <END> called <START:organization> Mechanical Turk <END> , but he said the service did not give him much control over who was working on <START:organization> Getty’s <END> tagging projects .
An appealing part of <START:organization> Spare5’s <END> pitch , he said , is that it will use people who are qualified to do so to tag his images , based on their interests and expertise .
( Users of the app complete a questionnaire and provide links to their social media pages . )
About 12,000 people have downloaded the app , a quarter of whom actively use it , <START:organization> Spare5 <END> said .
One of them is <START:person> Courtney Dale <END> , a designer at an architecture firm in <START:location> Metairie , La. <END> , who has made about $ 126 each of the last two weeks by using the app two to three hours a day , which qualifies her as an unusually industrious user of <START:organization> Spare5 <END> .
“It does make you look at what you do when you’re just sitting around doing nothing , ” Ms. Dale , 25 , said .
“How did I feel comfortable just wasting time playing <START:organization> Angry Birds <END> ? ”
There is something concerning , though , about the idea that unpaid spare time is time squandered .
<START:person> Arun Sundararajan <END> , a professor at <START:organization> New York University’s <END> <START:organization> Stern School of Business <END> , says that services like <START:organization> Spare5 <END> can be empowering to people who want more control over when and how they work , even if it ’s for peanuts .
But he says that can be taken too far .
“Spare time is a good thing to have , ” he said .
“You don’t want to spend every minute making money . ”

When you walk into a meeting , there’s always someone who thinks he or she is the smartest person in the room .
A meeting room is often the “Breakfast Club ” of the working world .
You’ve got the extrovert , the introvert , the know-it-all and the ambitious steamroller .
No matter what the mix , there’s always someone who dominates the discussion , and others who defer to that person out of frustration — or worse , complacency .
But getting the best work out of a team is n’t about silencing the loudest person .
It’s about getting everyone involved to explore every angle , bring all ideas to the surface and collaborate on a path forward .
Two years ago , I was asked to lead the transformation of product design at <START:organization> IBM <END> .
My challenge is n’t simply to add designers .
It’s to create agile , multidisciplinary teams that include designers , developers and product managers .
Designing around the user experience , part of what’s known as “design thinking , ” has become crucial to the success of business software .
It’s not simply because people expect consumer-type experiences at work , but also because the information we receive and the speed with which we’re expected to deal with it have exploded in just a few years .
Work tools must be redesigned for this new complexity .
I’ve seen that team members are pretty good at organizing themselves when they have established relationships .
When people know one another and have developed empathy and trust , the issue of getting everyone’s ideas on the table does n’t come up much .
Over time you learn about each other , come to respect those who can contribute and just figure out how to work together .
I’ve seen this happen more often than not .
But when your organization is in the midst of transformation — whether it is a three-person start-up hiring a fourth employee or a big global company leading major shifts in technology — you are faced with teams of people who don’t necessarily have the shared experiences that enable them to behave well together .
Team dynamics can easily get in the way of good ideas , and the loudest voice often wins .
I used to lead start-ups and have found that the same basic meeting practices can be used no matter what the size of a company .
These strategies are effective with design thinking because they not only unleash everyone’s creativity but also give voice to every idea .
It has been my experience that the biggest impediment to getting people to think about what’s possible — instead of what’s not possible — is the difficulty in exposing everyone’s ideas to the broader team .
So we focus on two things : getting everyone to contribute and letting everyone’s contribution be heard .
That does n’t come naturally .
Sometimes organizational hierarchy might prevent a good idea from being considered because it was n’t shared .
So at IBM , we intentionally assemble teams that span skills , levels of experience and points of view .
And then ?
It starts with a sticky note and a pen .
We did this for our new business email tool , <START:organization> IBM Verse <END> , which helps workers prioritize tasks and find the right people and information quickly .
We began not by declaring that we wanted to transform enterprise email , but by asking the team to think about what people dislike about email .
In cases like this , we begin by holding workshops where teams are given minimal instructions , and pen and paper .
After the team leader presents a challenge , the room goes silent .
Everyone spends 10 minutes writing their thoughts on sticky notes .
One idea per note .
No talking allowed .
Then , idea by idea , people post their sticky notes on a big whiteboard .
There’s still no talking , no judging yourself or others .
It’s total mindfulness about the user’s experience .
There’s no battling over the best ideas or who owns what .
Just get your thoughts out of your brain and on the wall .
The group keeps posting sticky notes until they slow to a dribble .
When the members are done , everyone steps back .
We call this popcorning .
You don’t want to give people too much time .
The point is to get everyone involved quickly .
Then , the team leader groups the sticky notes into overlapping and logical areas .
People take it all in , reflect , and then they disappear .
They are free to leave the room — or the building — to brainstorm with colleagues face to face , on the phone or via a group texting tool .
This opens up the playing field to less-vocal members of the team who are more apt to speak up online .
After this freestyle brainstorming , the group returns to the room , sometimes after minutes but it could be hours or even days .
Invariably they bring at least a couple dozen new ideas .
Those go up on the board .
Getting every idea in front of the team is important because it ’s very difficult to quash a good idea if it ’s shared .
Once you know something , you can’t unknow it — you have to act .
None of this is rocket science , but it ’s powerful if applied consistently .
It makes for better teams and it leads to better outcomes .
When you give voice to more people , the best ideas win , not the loudest ones .

Rising income inequality has set off fierce political and economic debates , but one important angle has n’t been explored adequately .
We need to ask whether market forces themselves might limit or reverse the trend .
Technology has contributed to the rise in inequality , but there are also some significant ways in which technology could reduce it .
For example , while computers have improved our lives in many ways , they have n’t yet done much to make health care and education cheaper .
Over the next few decades , however , that may well change : We can easily imagine medical diagnosis by online artificial intelligence , greater use of online competitive procurement for health care services , more transparency in pricing and thus more competition , and much cheaper online education for many students , to cite just a few possibilities .
In such a world , many wage gains would come from new and cheaper services , rather than from being able to cut a better deal with the boss at work .
It is a bit harder to see how information technology can lower housing costs , but perhaps the sharing economy can make it easier to live in much smaller spaces and rent needed items , rather than store them in a house or apartment .
That would enable lower-income people to live closer to higher-paying urban jobs and at lower cost .
Another set of future gains , especially for lesser-skilled workers , may come as computers become easier to handle for people with rudimentary skill .
Not everyone can work fruitfully with computers now .
There is a generation gap when it comes to manipulating electronic devices , and many relevant tasks require knowledge of programming or , more ambitiously , the entrepreneurial skill of creating a start-up .
That , in a nutshell , is how our dynamic sector has concentrated its gains among a relatively small number of employees , thus leading to more income inequality .
This particular type of inequality may very well change .
As the previous generation retires from the work force , many more people will have grown up with intimate knowledge of computers .
And over time , it may become easier to work with computers just by talking to them .
As computer-human interfaces become simpler and easier to manage , that may raise the relative return to less-skilled labor .
The future may also extend a growing category of employment , namely workers who team up with smart robots that require human assistance .
Perhaps a smart robot will perform some of the current functions of a factory worker , while the human companion will do what the robot cannot , such as deal with a system breakdown or call a supervisor .
Such jobs would require versatility and flexible reasoning , a bit like some of the old manufacturing jobs , but not necessarily a lot of high-powered technical training , again because of the greater ease of the human-computer interface .
That too could raise the returns to many relatively unskilled workers .
A more universal expertise with information technology also might reverse some of the income inequalities that stem from finance .
For instance , the returns from high-frequency trading were higher a few years ago , in part because few firms used it ; now many firms can trade at very high speeds .
It remains to be seen whether similar developments will lower hedge fund returns , but again it is possible to imagine a future in which many of the best investment and trading techniques are very widely copied and thus cease to be especially profitable .
A final set of forces to reverse growing inequality stem from the emerging economies , most of all <START:location> China <END> .
Perhaps we are living in a temporary intermediate period when <START:location> America <END> and many other developed nations bear a lot of the costs of Chinese economic development without yet getting many of the potential benefits .
For instance , <START:location> China <END> and other emerging nations are already rich enough to bid up commodity prices and large enough to drive down the wages of a lot of American middle-class workers , especially in manufacturing .
Yet while these emerging economies are keeping down the costs of manufactured goods for American consumers , they are not yet innovative enough to send us many fantastic new products , the way that the <START:location> United States <END> sends a stream of new products to British or French consumers , to their benefit .
That state of affairs will probably end .
Over the next few decades , we can expect <START:location> China <END> , <START:location> India <END> and other emerging nations to supply more innovations to the global economy , including to the <START:location> United States <END> .
This should n’t be a cause for alarm .
It will lead to many good things .
Since the emerging economies are relatively poor , many of these innovations may benefit relatively low-income Americans .
<START:location> India <END> has already pioneered techniques for cheap , high-quality heart surgery and other medical procedures , and over time such techniques may achieve a foothold in the <START:location> United States <END> .
Imagine a future <START:location> China <END> producing cheaper and safer cars , a cure for some kinds of cancer , and workable battery storage for solar energy .
Ordinary Americans could be much better off , and without having to work for those gains .
To be clear , these are speculations and should not be taken as reasons to avoid improving our economy right now ; furthermore , other trends may push in less positive directions .
Still , these possibilities reframe the inequality problem .
In the popular model developed by the economist <START:person> Thomas Piketty <END> , inequality is fundamentally about capital versus labor .
In his view , capital has opened up an ever-widening lead because of the relatively high rates of return on savings and investment .
The natural response to reverse this trend , according to <START:person> Mr. Piketty <END> , would be a direct attack on the return to capital , such as through a global wealth tax .
In the scenarios outlined here , though , growing inequality is highly contingent on particular technologies and the global conditions of the moment .
Movements toward greater inequality often set countervailing forces in motion , even if those forces take a long time to come to fruition .
From this perspective , rather than seeking to beat down capital , our attention should be directed to leaving open the future possibilities for innovation , change and dynamism .
Even if income inequality continues to increase in the short run , as I believe is likely , there exists a plausible and more distant future in which we are mostly much better off and more equal .
The history of technology suggests that new opportunities for better living and higher wages are being created , just not as quickly as we might like .

<START:organization> Cisco Systems <END> on Friday filed a suit against <START:organization> Arista Networks <END> , a networking switch company and fast-moving competitor , accusing it of copying large amounts of <START:organization> Cisco’s <END> work .
<START:organization> Cisco <END> contends that <START:organization> Arista <END> violated 14 <START:organization> Cisco <END> patents , some of which were based on work by <START:person> Andreas Bechtolsheim <END> and <START:person> David Cheriton, <END> <START:organization> Arista’s <END> founders , when they were at <START:organization> Cisco <END> .
The two men , well-respected engineers , sold a company , <START:organization> Granite Systems <END> , to <START:organization> Cisco <END> in 1996 .
They are also both billionaires , thanks in part to being the first two significant outside investors in <START:organization> Google <END> .
The case , filed in the <START:organization> Federal District Court <END> in <START:location> Northern California <END> , will probably go on for at least months .
<START:organization> Cisco <END> is seeking <START:organization> Arista <END> to withdraw essentially all of its crucial products from the market .
<START:organization> Cisco <END> is also likely to seek damages , said <START:person> Mark Chandler <END> , the company ’s general counsel .
“We are not a litigious company , ” said <START:person> Mr. Chandler <END> .
“This was so blatant . ”
<START:organization> Cisco <END> was filing suit , he said , because otherwise competing companies might also try to make use of <START:organization> Cisco <END> products .
“ I am disappointed at <START:organization> Cisco’s <END> tactics , ” said <START:person> Jayshree Ullal <END> , <START:organization> Arista’s <END> chief executive , in a statement .
<START:person> Ms. Ullal <END> , also a <START:organization> Cisco <END> veteran .
added , “it’s not the <START:organization> Cisco <END> I knew . ”
Though the two companies have in the past consulted over various matters , persons familiar with the suit said <START:organization> Arista <END> was unaware <START:organization> Cisco <END> was planning the action .
Besides technical patents , <START:organization> Cisco <END> says that <START:organization> Arista’s <END> command line interface , a way of operating its switch , includes more than 500 of the commands used in <START:organization> Cisco <END> gear .
<START:organization> Arista <END> did this , <START:organization> Cisco <END> says , in order to easily win over <START:organization> Cisco <END> customers .
The suit quotes <START:person> Kenneth Duda <END> , another founder of <START:organization> Arista <END> , along with Ms. Ullal , saying in interviews how much <START:organization> Arista <END> resembles <START:organization> Cisco <END> .
“They said it is comfortable for customers ” to use the same commands , <START:person> Mr. Chandler <END> said .
“They did it intentionally . ”
<START:organization> Cisco <END> also included as evidence grammatical errors in <START:organization> Cisco <END> user manuals that were identical in <START:organization> Arista <END> manuals .
More than a decade ago , <START:organization> Cisco <END> used similar documentation in a copying suit against the Chinese networking gear maker , <START:organization> Huawei <END> .
That suit was eventually settled .

Updated , 9:10 p.m. | <START:location> OAKLAND , Calif <END> .
— The lawyers fighting <START:organization> Apple <END> in a class-action lawsuit involving iPods have managed to do a few remarkable things : They persuaded a judge to bring a decade-old lawsuit to trial here last week , for one .
They even managed to drag the famous <START:person> Steve Jobs <END> into giving a videotaped testimony shortly before he died three years ago .
But they have one big problem : Their case has no plaintiff .
A federal judge on Monday disqualified the only remaining plaintiff in the case , <START:person> Marianna Rosen <END> of <START:location> New Jersey <END> , after <START:organization> Apple’s <END> lawyers successfully argued that she did not even buy any iPods for which she is seeking damages .
That argument also gave Apple an opening last week to ask <START:person> Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers <END> , the federal judge overseeing the case , to throw out the suit .
The judge , however , disagreed with <START:organization> Apple’s <END> argument that it was too late to add a new plaintiff .
She ordered the plaintiff lawyers to find one by Tuesday morning .
The judge appeared annoyed about the discrepancies with <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> iPods and scolded the plaintiff lawyers for failing to do their homework .
Another plaintiff in the case dropped out last week .
“You’ve certainly created a problem on the plaintiffs ’ side , ” <START:person> Judge Gonzalez Rogers <END> said before reaching her decision .
The lawsuit , filed a decade ago , involves older iPods , which played only songs sold in the iTunes Store , or those downloaded from CDs — not music from competing stores .
The plaintiff lawyers represent consumers who say <START:organizationn> Apple <END> violated antitrust law because to keep their music , people had to stay with the iPod and buy higher-priced ones rather than cheaper , alternative music players .
For this , the plaintiff lawyers want <START:organization> Apple <END> to pay consumers at least $ 350 million in damages .
The lawyers suing Apple were busy over the weekend , filing papers about <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> standing as a witness .
Last week , <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> testified that she had bought two iPods : an iPod Nano in the fall of 2007 and an iPod Touch in December 2008 .
Apple’s lawyer asked whether <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> kept receipts for her purchases .
<START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> said she probably did not have the paper receipts , but later said her iPod Touch was in her bag .
<START:organization> Apple’s <END> lawyers looked up the serial number of <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> iPod Touch and found records showing it was bought in July 2009 .
The class action seeks damages for iPods bought from September 2006 to March 2009 .
So this iPod Touch missed the cutoff .
<START:organization> Apple’s <END> lawyers last Wednesday pointed out the discrepancy about <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> iPod Touch in a letter to the judge .
They also raised similar concerns about the second plaintiff’s iPod purchases .
On Friday , the second plaintiff dropped out of the case , leaving <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> as the lone plaintiff .
<START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> lawyers then provided <START:organization> Apple <END> a receipt showing two iPod purchases made in September 2008 .
But <START:organization> Apple <END> pulled up its copy of the receipt for those iPods , which indicated they were bought by the <START:organization> Rosen Law Firm <END> , the firm owned by <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> husband .
<START:organization> Apple’s <END> lawyers argued that these were not iPods bought directly by <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> , and therefore she could not claim injury .
Over the weekend , <START:person> Ms. Rosen’s <END> lawyers filed a letter including a declaration by <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> about the iPods .
In it , <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> said that on Sept. 11 , 2008 , she bought an iPod Touch — not the same one that she brought to court .
She also said that on the same day , she bought the iPod Nano .
In her declaration , <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> also said that she bought the iPods for her own use , not for her husband’s law firm .
But she said that she believed the credit card she used was issued in both her name and that of the family business , the <START:organization> Rosen Law Firm <END> , and that she was authorized to make personal purchases with it .
In summary , <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> amended her testimony , saying that she bought two iPods on the same day in September 2008 .
Despite that , the judge said late Monday that <START:person> Ms. Rosen <END> was inadequate to serve as a plaintiff .
<START:person> Bonny Sweeney <END> , the plaintiff’s lead attorney , told the judge that a number of people had approached her team over the weekend , asking to be considered as plaintiffs , and many had already been interviewed .
“Yes , we certainly have another plaintiff , ” she said .

AN old Viennese saying to the effect that " the situation is hopeless but not serious " seems to sum up what several <START:location> Madison Avenue <END> thought leaders believe lies in store for the industry next year .
The senior executives , in presentations on Monday at an annual media conference , predicted that the rough times the advertising business has endured for the last several years would continue into 2015 .
Still , there will be steady growth in worldwide advertising spending of 4.8 to 5 percent compared with this year , according to their forecasts , as a result of factors that include gains in digital ad sales and improving economic conditions in markets like <START:location> India <END> and the <START:location> United States <END> .
The better outcome the executives anticipate for 2015 compared with 2014 may not warrant dancing a Viennese waltz , but would be respectable , they suggested , in light of the many issues that worry them and marketer clients .
" If anybody in this room thinks life is easy , " said <START:person> Martin Sorrell <END> , chief executive of <START:organization> WPP <END> , the world 's largest agency holding group in revenue , " think again . "
He cited a news story late last week in <START:person> London <END> , where <START:organization> WPP <END> is based , reporting that a giant marketer , <START:organization> Premier Foods <END> , "was asking its suppliers , including advertising agencies , to pay a sort of toll or fee to earn the right " to continue doing business with the company in what is called a pay-and-stay arrangement .
Although <START:organization> Premier <END> executives subsequently "withdrew " those requests , <START:person> Mr. Sorrell <END> said , it underscored " the tough economic position " of advertisers and how " the pressure to reduce costs " is now a constant .
" The biggest challenge we face as an industry is convincing clients to focus on the top line rather than reducing costs , " he added , and to realize that ad spending is " an investment , not a cost . "
As for agencies , <START:person> Mr. Sorrell <END> said , " the pressure is intensifying " in areas like payment terms , where clients want more leeway .
Yet in a tough , troubled climate , it will be " the same again " for ad spending next year as it was this year , he added : trudging ahead from the previous year despite "gray swans " -- <START:person> Mr. Sorrell <END> 's term for " known unknowns " that plays off "black swans , " or unforeseen crises .
<START:person> Mr. Sorrell <END> spoke during the first day of the 42nd annual <START:organization> UBS Global Media and Communications Conference <END> , which continues in <START:location> Midtown Manhattan <END> through Wednesday .
His wide-ranging remarks -- which included predictions that no party may be able to form a government after the British election next year and that <START:person> Hillary Rodham Clinton <END> would be elected president in 2016 -- followed the morning keynote , a panel of three media agency leaders offering ad forecasts .
Conditions in the ad and media industry are "unrelentingly tough , " <START:person> Steve King <END> , chief executive of the <START:organization> ZenithOptimedia <END> division of the <START:organization> Publicis Groupe <END> said in an interview , "because everyone 's trying to squeeze you " and " the pain for not getting it right is greater " than it used to be .
Despite its being " a hard slog , " he added , the business "is in reasonably good shape " because of growth in digital ad spending , "almost entirely coming from newspapers and magazines " ; robust gains in mobile ad spending ; and improvements in " steady-growth " markets like <START:location> Australia <END> and the <START:location> United States <END> as well as "fast-growth " markets like <START:location> China <END> , <START:location> India <END> and <START:location> Latin America <END> .
A second panelist , <START:person> Vincent Letang <END> , executive vice president and director for global forecasting at the <START:organization> Magna Global <END> unit of the <START:organization> Interpublic Group of Companies <END> , said he expected the outcome for 2015 to be " not fantastic , but a decent performance . "
After that , he added , worldwide ad growth " will fluctuate between 5 and 6 percent a year . "
A third panelist , <START:person> Adam Smith <END> , futures director of <START:organization> GroupM <END> , owned by <START:organization> WPP <END> , wondered how much ad spending may pick up if oil prices , which have sharply declined recently , remain low or head lower .
That would be "quite a strong positive , " he said , because marketers could run more ads to woo consumers who have more to spend as they spend less for gasoline .
<START:person> Mr. Smith <END> 's forecast for 4.9 percent worldwide ad spending growth in 2015 compared with this year is predicated , he said , on continued gains for digital ads as some ad markets that previously grew rapidly slow down or , in the case of <START:location> Russia <END> , turn negative .
As for television ad spending , Mr. Smith cast doubt on some predictions that it would decline significantly soon or that digital ad spending would increase at the expense of television .
" Print is the organ donor for digital , " he said , adding : " Print was low-hanging fruit for the Internet .
TV dollars are much further up in the canopy . "
Another speaker , <START:person> David F. Poltrack <END> , chief research officer of a television giant , the <START:organization> CBS Corporation <END> , acknowledged difficulties for the medium like "resistance in the upfront market " from advertisers that balked at buying commercial time before the start of the 2014-15 season and " a mercurial scatter market " -- buying commercial time during the season -- " that fluctuates from day to day . "
Viewers are certainly watching more streaming video , <START:person> Mr. Poltrack <END> said , but decisions to shift ad dollars there from television may be premature until more reliable measurement of viewing habits is available .
Digital media is not necessarily antithetical to television , he added , noting that "one million people are watching ' <START:organization> The Big Bang Theory <END> ' on <START:organization> cbs.com <END> " rather than on the <START:organization> CBS <END> broadcast network .
<START:person> Mr. Smith <END> of <START:organization> GroupM <END> said much the same thing , telling the audience , " If we are going to be predicting doom for TV , let 's look at the numbers first . "

Updated , 8:47 p.m. | Deal making in the health care industry has been booming all year , with medical technology companies and cosmetic drug makers changing hands at rich premiums .
Now a different part of the industry — antibiotics — is at the center of the mergers and acquisitions frenzy .
<START:organization> Merck & Company <END> said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire <START:organization> Cubist Pharmaceuticals <END> for $ 8.4 billion , plus the assumption of $ 1.1 billion in debt .
The deal will give <START:organization> Merck <END> , the second-largest American drug maker after <START:organization> Pfizer <END> , control of the largest antibiotics company , and deepen its ties with hospitals .
The deal fits into <START:organization> Merck’s <END> strategy of buying midsize drug makers that complement its existing products .
<START:organization> Merck <END> will pay $ 102 a share in cash for <START:organization> Cubist <END> , a 35 percent premium above <START:organization> Cubist’s <END> average share price for the five most recent trading days .
<START:organization> Cubist <END> , based in <START:location> Lexington , Mass. <END> , makes drugs to treat dangerous bacteria and superbugs , including diseases that can cause pandemics .
Its biggest seller , <START:organization> Cubicin <END> , fits nicely into <START:organization> Merck’s <END> hospital division , one of four areas that executives recently identified as priorities for the company .
Sales in <START:organization> Merck’s <END> hospital acute care division were 10 percent higher in the first three quarters of this year than in the same period last year .
Drug makers are showing renewed interest in antibiotics now that the <START:organization> Food and Drug Administration <END> is offering incentives to manufacturers to invest in new products .
Until recently , drug makers had shied away from developing new antibiotics because there was little financial motivation to do so .
“Large pharma had evacuated the space about a decade ago , ” said <START:person> Liisa Bayko <END> , an analyst at <START:organization> JMP Securities <END> .
“There were a number of regulatory hurdles with the <START:organization> F.D.A. <END> that were getting very onerous . ”
But now , companies that develop antibiotics can qualify for speedier approvals and can sell their products exclusively for longer periods as part of an effort to combat the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant diseases .
And last year , the federal government announced an agreement to pay <START:organization> GlaxoSmithKline <END> $ 40 million to help it develop drugs that could fight antibiotic resistance and biological agents that terrorists might use .
<START:organization> Merck <END> said the deal with <START:organization> Cubist <END> was about expanding revenue , rather than looking for cost savings .
“The rationale for this deal is revenue growth , ” <START:person> Kenneth C. Frazier <END> , <START:organization> Merck’s <END> chief executive , said in a telephone interview on Monday .
“Our ability to take these products and take them , for example , globally where we have strength around the world is a great opportunity to grow . ”
<START:organization> Cubist <END> has promising drugs in the pipeline , including those it obtained through two corporate acquisitions of its own .
<START:organization> Cubist <END> bought <START:organization> Optimer <END> and <START:organization> Trius <END> last year , paying about $ 800 million for each .
For <START:organization> Merck <END> , buying <START:organization> Cubist <END> allowed it to instantly bolster its presence in antibiotics .
<START:organization> Cubist <END> is alone among companies of its size in having a robust portfolio of antibiotics .
“This is the only company that has multiple antibiotics , ” <START:person> Ms. Bayko <END> said .
“If you wanted to get in in a big way , this is the only way to do it . ”
By selling to <START:organization> Merck <END> , <START:organization> Cubist <END> will be able to expand internationally at a faster clip .
<START:organization> Cubist <END> antibiotics are sold only in the United States and Canada , though the company was working on expanding to Western Europe .
“With <START:organization> Merck <END> taking over we have access to this Class A infrastructure around the world , ” said <START:person> Michael Bonney <END> , <START:organization> Cubist’s <END> chief executive .
<START:organization> Merck <END> also said it saw opportunity in expanding sales of <START:organization> Cubist’s <END> products around the world .
International sales of <START:organization> Cubist’s <END> products made up just 6 percent of the company ’s revenues in the first nine months of this year .
<START:person> Mr. Frazier <END> said that <START:organization> Merck <END> would continue to buy smaller companies such as <START:organization> Cubist <END> , rather than focus on a megamerger like the $ 66 billion takeover of the Botox maker <START:organization> Allergan <END> by <START:organization> Actavis <END> .
“We’re an innovation-focused company , ” he said .
“We will use business development and M&A to get access to the best science that we can .
We’re not as interested in doing a large consolidation merger that is driven by cost synergies .
A large consolidation transaction to us would be a distraction . ”
<START:organization> Merck <END> approached <START:organization> Cubist <END> about a deal earlier this year , <START:person> Mr. Bonney <END> said in an interview .
“As we worked with them , the board decided to do a very thorough market check , ” <START:person> Mr. Bonney <END> said .
“We did have multiple interested parties , but <START:organization> Merck <END> offered the best price and was the best fit . ”
The $ 8.4 billion price has been approved unanimously by the boards of both companies and includes the assumption of about $ 1.1 billion in debt , bringing the enterprise value of the deal to $ 9.5 billion .
<START:organization> Merck <END> , through a subsidiary , will begin a tender offer to investors to acquire all of <START:organization> Cubist’s <END> outstanding shares .
Shares of <START:organization> Cubist <END> jumped 35 percent on Monday , to about $ 100.60 .
<START:organization> Merck <END> shares closed 0.6 percent higher , at $ 61.88 .
“We’re certainly satisfied with the price we got for shareholders , ” <START:person> Mr. Bonney <END> said .
The deal , which is subject to approval by regulators , is expected to close in the first quarter .
<START:organization> DealBook <END> reported that a deal was in the works after the market closed on Friday .
Last month , <START:organization> Cubist <END> posted third-quarter sales of $ 309 million , a 16 percent increase from the period a year earlier .
<START:organization> Merck <END> makes vaccines , prescription products and oncology treatments .
It posted revenue of about $ 10.6 billion in the third quarter .
It said <START:organization> Cubist <END> would add more than $ 1 billion to its expected 2015 revenues .
The deal is the latest bolt-on acquisition for <START:organization> Merck <END> , which has been looking to bolster its portfolio of drugs even as it faces increased competition from generic drug producers .
It agreed in June , for example , to a $ 3.85 billion deal for <START:organization> Idenix Pharmaceuticals <END> , a maker of treatments for hepatitis C.
But <START:organization> Merck <END> has also shed noncore businesses .
Earlier this year , it sold its consumer business to Bayer for $ 14.2 billion .
<START:organization> JPMorgan Chase <END> , <START:organization> Deutsche Bank <END> and the law firms <START:organization> Hughes Hubbard & Reed <END> and <START:organization> Baker & McKenzie <END> advised <START:organization> Merck <END> , while <START:organization> Morgan Stanley <END> , <START:organization> Goldman Sachs <END> and the law firm <START:organization> Ropes & Gray <END> advised <START:organization> Cubist <END> .
<START:person> Katie Thomas <END> and <START:person> Chad Bray <END> contributed reporting .

<START:location> NEW DELHI <END> — The Delhi region on Monday banned <START:organization> Uber <END> , the popular hail-a-ride service , after one of its drivers appeared in court on suspicion of raping a passenger who dozed off during a ride home only to discover that the driver had taken her to a secluded spot and climbed into the back of the vehicle .
Criticism of <START:organization> Uber’s <END> licensing and screening procedures was heightened when it emerged that the driver , <START:person> Shiv Kumar Yadav <END> , had been detained for seven months on suspicion of raping another female passenger three years ago .
That case was ultimately closed and <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> was acquitted , said <START:person> Madhur Verma <END> , the deputy commissioner of the police for the northern district of <START:location> New Delhi <END> .
Regional authorities followed up late on Monday by banning all taxi services based on smartphone apps , which may result in the closure of as many as 20 popular services .
Since its launch last December , <START:organization> Uber <END> had gained a large following among young , tech-savvy women in Delhi , where finding safe transportation after dark is especially difficult .
But the new service — which uses a smartphone app to link customers with available drivers — ran afoul of well-established taxi firms and with government regulators , who saw so-called aggregators as ducking legal and safety obligations shouldered by ordinary city cabs .
<START:organization> Uber <END> is running into similar problems in cities in other countries .
A Dutch court on Monday prohibited the <START:organization> UberPop <END> service , which links clients with drivers who do not have professional licenses , from operating in the Netherlands .
The <START:organization> UberPop <END> service has been banned in the German cities of <START:location> Berlin <END> and <START:location> Hamburg <END> , and <START:person> London <END> ’s main taxi association has brought lawsuits against <START:organization> Uber <END> and a number of its drivers .
Lawmakers in <START:location> Thailand <END> and <START:location> Vietnam <END> have banned the service , and the city government in <START:location> Seoul <END> has said it plans to do the same .
None of these cases were as dramatic , though , as the one unfolding here .
<START:location> Delhi <END> has yet to recover from a brutal rape that took place two years ago , when a woman returning home after seeing a movie boarded a private bus with a male companion and was gang-raped so brutally that she later died of her injuries .
A wave of street demonstrations followed that crime , and the authorities appeared to be braced on Monday for turbulence that did not materialize .
As the driver , <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> , left a courthouse in <START:location> Delhi <END> , he was surrounded by around three dozen police officers who whisked him away at a sprint .
<START:organization> Uber <END> executives , too , seemed to be girding themselves for a fight .
The company ’s chief executive , <START:person> Travis Kalanick <END> , issued a statement saying that <START:organization> Uber <END> “will work with the government to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs . ”
He also said <START:organization> Uber <END> would try to use technological advances “to help make <START:location> New Delhi <END> a safer city for women . ”
“ What happened over the weekend in <START:location> New Delhi <END> is horrific , ” the statement said .
“Our entire team’s hearts go out to the victim of this despicable crime .
We will do everything , I repeat , everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice and support the victim and her family in her recovery . ”
Women here are severely constrained by the difficulty of finding safe transportation after dark .
In an essay published Monday , one high-ranking news executive recalled working late on a story early in her career and being mortified when her father called to berate her editor for exposing her to danger , “reducing me to a helpless little girl in front of my boss . ”
<START:organization> Uber <END> attracted business swiftly , in part because its marketing material focused so squarely on safety .
Much of the reaction to the reported rape has had a tinge of betrayal .
<START:organization> “Uber <END> was the one thing that gave me the confidence to feel independent in <START:location> Delhi <END> , which you don’t feel here , ” said <START:person> Neha Sinha <END> , 28 , who said she had used the service regularly for the last six months .
“Now I’m back to square one . ”
<START:person> Ayesha Perera <END> , in a commentary on the news website <START:organization> Firstpost <END> , said she had become equally relaxed about late-night cab rides , and could sympathize with the reported victim .
“It is likely that she was sufficiently relaxed to nod off precisely because she believed she was safe in an <START:organization> Uber <END> , ” she wrote .
The woman , who is in her late 20s and works at a finance company , was returning from <START:location> New Delhi <END> to her home in nearby Gurgaon on Friday night .
She said she awoke after <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> had changed his route , taking her to a secluded area not far from a garbage dump .
He then parked and raped her , she told the police early Saturday morning .
<START:person> Mr. Verma <END> , the police investigator , said a physical examination showed signs of a “fierce sexual assault and rape . ”
The police said the woman took a photograph of the cab , including its license plate , using the camera on her mobile phone , which she provided to the police .
<START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> was arrested Sunday night , when police burst into a house where he had barricaded himself , in his native village 90 miles southeast of <START:location> New Delhi <END> .
During questioning , <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> confessed to raping his passenger on Friday , as well as another woman he drove home in 2011 , <START:person> Mr. Verma <END> said .
It remains unclear how <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> was hired given the previous allegations against him .
In 2011 , then driving a cab for another service , he picked up a 22-year-old woman who needed to go home after working a night shift at a bar .
She later told the police he had driven her to a farmhouse and raped her ; a medical examination confirmed a sexual assault .
<START:organization> Uber <END> does not conduct background checks on its drivers in <START:location> India <END> , one of its local executives , Neeraj Singhal , told The Wall Street Journal last month .
It accepts partner drivers if they have valid insurance documents , a driver’s license and a commercial permit to drive a taxi , he said .
The <START:organization> Delhi Transport Department <END> acknowledged , in a statement , that it had granted <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> an “All-India Tourist Permit ” this May , “after due verification of character and antecedents of the permit holder . ”
It added , however , that such a permit did not authorize him to carry local fares within <START:location> Delhi <END> .
Police investigators have been scathing in describing their dealings with <START:organization> Uber <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Verma <END> said he was unable to find any contact number or email address for <START:organization> Uber <END> on its web pages and finally located its headquarters by booking an <START:organization> Uber <END> cab and asking to be taken to the company ’s head office , which turned out to be several rooms in a hotel .
He said he was not able to get any information about Friday ’s bookings for five hours because the database was in New York .
<START:person> Mr. Verma <END> also said that <START:organization> Uber <END> had failed to demand that <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> show a badge , which can only be acquired by submitting to a criminal background check .
He said <START:organization> Uber <END> had registered <START:person> Mr. Yadav <END> under an inaccurate residential address , had not registered his vehicle as a cab , and had not installed a global positioning system in the vehicle , which is mandatory for commercial taxis .
In fact , <START:organization> Uber <END> and other “aggregators , ” as they are known , manage to duck regulations that apply to traditional city cabs — including the requirement that each driver possess a badge , said <START:person> Kunal Lalani <END> , the president of the <START:organization> Association of Radio Taxis <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Lalani <END> said “this new technology business , ” including <START:organization> Uber <END> , had initially focused on “the luxury segment , ” and that risks had only begun to increase as they expanded into what he called “the entry-level segment . ”
“ Unfortunately , this guy was a single taxi owner , and he went and joined <START:organization> Uber <END> , ” he said .
“As long as <START:organization> Uber <END> was doing premium services , there was never a problem .
There was always going to be an owner who was vigilant .
They have now gone on to the entry-level services . ”

<START:location> SEOUL , South Korea <END> — <START:location> North Korea <END> on Sunday denied responsibility for hacking the computers of <START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> Entertainment but appeared to relish the attack that crippled the computer systems of the <START:location> Hollywood <END> company , which is set to release a comedy that involves a plot to assassinate its leader , <START:person> Kim Jong-un <END> .
<START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> is producing “a film abetting a terrorist act while hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership , ” a spokesman of the <START:organization> National Defense Commission <END> , <START:person> Mr. Kim’s <END> top governing agency in <START:location> Pyongyang <END> , was quoted as saying by the North’s <START:organization> Korean Central News Agency <END> .
The spokesman said <START:location> North Korea <END> did not know why <START:organization> Sony <END> was targeted , but he speculated that the attack “might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with ” <START:location> North Korea <END> in its struggle to “put an end to U.S. imperialism . ”
A hacking attack last month shut down the computer systems of <START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> and exposed a trove of internal data , including salary figures .
<START:location> North Korea <END> has since emerged as a possible suspect because it has been criticizing <START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> for producing “The Interview , ” a comedy starring <START:person> Seth Rogen <END> and <START:person> James Franco <END> that involves the assassination plot against <START:person> Mr. Kim <END> .
<START:location> North Korea <END> saw no humor there .
It has called the movie “an act of war ” sponsored by <START:location> Washington <END> ’s “hostile policy . ”
<START:person> Mr. Kim’s <END> family has been ruling <START:location> North Korea <END> since the late 1940s with a totalitarian grip that has rested upon a personality cult .
The government in <START:location> Pyongyang <END> lashes out at any attempt from the outside to criticize <START:person> Mr. Kim <END> , calling it a challenge to the “supreme dignity ” of the entire country .
It has been especially sensitive about such criticism in recent weeks because there was an American-supported attempt at the <START:organization> United Nations <END> to ask the <START:organization> Security Council <END> to refer <START:person> Mr. Kim <END> to an international criminal court for human rights abuses .
No direct evidence has emerged yet that links <START:location> North Korea <END> to the hacking attack at <START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> , and digital-security analysts have been divided over the likelihood of its involvement .
On Sunday , <START:location> North Korea <END> said there were “a great number of supporters and sympathizers ” with <START:location> North Korea <END> “all over the world , ” including “champions of peace ” who might initiate more “righteous reaction ” against the <START:location> United States’ <END> “evildoings . ”
South Korean and American officials have been increasingly concerned about <START:location> North Korea’s <END> capability to carry out attacks on computers , especially after huge disruptions of bank , government , media and military websites in <START:location> South Korea <END> in recent years that <START:location> South Korea <END> attributed to attacks sponsored by the North .
<START:location> North Korea <END> has denied involvement and instead blamed <START:location> South Korea <END> for disrupting its websites in recent years .
<START:location> North Korea <END> itself is cut off from the Internet , except for a handful of state-approved websites linked to the World Wide Web.
But South Korean officials and defectors from <START:location> North Korea <END> said <START:location> North Korea <END> has been training specialists in computer attacks for decades to collect technological data through the Internet , spread the country ’s propaganda online and initiate hacking attacks .
In a report to <START:organization> Congress <END> last year , the <START:organization> United States Defense Department <END> said that given its bleak economic outlook , <START:location> North Korea <END> might see hacking attacks as “a cost-effective way to develop asymmetric , deniable military options . ”
In October , <START:location> South Korea’s <END> <START:organization> National Intelligence Service <END> told lawmakers that North Korean-sponsored hackers had spread game apps containing malicious viruses from May through September , affecting an estimated 20,000 South Korean smartphone users .
It did not reveal how it determined that such attacks were sponsored by <START:location> North Korea <END> .

One summer day two years ago , <START:person> Ivan Vesic <END> , a software engineer who lives in the southern Serbian city of <START:location> Nis <END> , rushed to a local veterinary clinic .
A car had hit his rescue cat , <START:person> Damian <END> , badly damaging his leg and tail .
The vet , <START:person> Mirza Sejdinovic <END> , had to amputate the cat’s tail but managed to save his leg .
<START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> sighed with relief ; Damian was going to be fine .
The two men began to chat and <START:person> Mr. Sejdinovic <END> complained about the software at his clinic .
<START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> looked at the computer screen and quickly concluded there must be a better way to manage a veterinary practice .
In the following weeks <START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> and <START:person> Mr. Sejdinovic <END> realized they could do something much more ambitious — create user-friendly software to be used by vet practices all over the world .
“We decided that we should actually quit our jobs and start building a start-up , ” <START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> said , adding that the team was joined by a third partner , <START:person> Milan Djordjevic <END> , a programmer .
Their company , <START:organization> VetCloud <END> , was born .
More than two years later , after extensive testing in the <START:location> Balkans <END> and <START:location> Britain <END> , its practice management software was introduced in <START:location> London <END> in November .
<START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> , 28 , <START:person> Mr. Sejdinovic <END> , 30 , and <START:person> Mr. Djordjevic <END> , 36 , are among hundreds of entrepreneurs in the <START:location> Balkans <END> who have launched tech start-ups that they hope to take global , at the same time transforming this ex-communist , relatively poor corner of <START:location> Europe <END> — known best abroad as war-torn , corrupt and unstable — into a hub for technology and innovation .
“ I believe it ’s only a matter of time before we have a Skype-level success from the region , ” said <START:person> Lyuben Belov <END> , managing partner at <START:organization> Launchub <END> , a seed fund based in the Bulgarian capital , <START:location> Sofia <END> , which invests in digital start-ups in southeast <START:location> Europe <END> .
“Someone will make it big on the global market , ” he added , predicting that a Balkan company would be traded on the <START:organization> Nasdaq <END> in <START:location> New York <END> one day .
Some Balkan start-ups , like <START:organization> Emailio <END> , a company co-founded by a Bulgarian high school student working on a mobile app to de-clutter inboxes , have moved to <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> .
<START:organization> Flipps <END> , an app that lets users stream video from mobile devices to a television , has also swapped <START:location> Bulgaria <END> for the <START:location> Bay Area <END> .
In another fillip for the region’s start-ups , <START:organization> Facebook <END> announced in July that it was buying <START:organization> LiveRail <END> , a video ad company co-founded by two Romanians , for a reported $ 400 million to $ 500 million .
In October , <START:organization> Progress Software <END> , based in <START:location> Bedford , Mass. <END> , said it planned to acquire <START:organization> Telerik <END> , a Bulgarian software company , for $ 262.5 million .
For years , big international companies have outsourced information technology work to <START:location> Eastern Europe <END> .
They have been attracted by relatively cheap labor , low rent and a pool of qualified software developers , whose skills reflect a tradition of strong math and engineering education that goes back to communist times .
Low business taxes help — <START:location> Bulgaria <END> , for example , offers a flat rate of 10 percent .
Now , those very same reasons are encouraging Balkan entrepreneurs to start their own businesses .
But the <START:location> Balkans <END> are up against tough competition from <START:location> Europe’s <END> top start-up destinations , like <START:location> London <END> , <START:location> Berlin <END> , <START:location> Helsinki <END> and <START:location> Stockholm <END> , where access to venture capital is easier and the start-up scene is much more advanced .
While Balkan entrepreneurs are blessed with ambition , tech know-how and enthusiasm , these would-be billionaires also face red tape , a dearth of government incentives and their own lack of business experience .
Balkan governments are slowly getting more involved in the sector .
Serbia has an Innovation Fund financed by the <START:organization> European Union <END> , which has awarded 53 grants , amounting to €6 million so far .
Sofia is building a €50 million technology park — also with funding from <START:location> Brussels <END> — to link local businesses and universities and foster innovation .
President <START:person> Rosen Plevneliev <END> of <START:location> Bulgaria <END> declared at a groundbreaking ceremony in July that it would be “the heart of start-up culture ” in the country .
Back in <START:location> Nis <END> , <START:organization> VetCloud’s <END> team has been developing a cloud-based software for vets , which stores medical records , handles appointments and sends alerts when new supplies of medicine are needed .
To win investment for their company , they did not go to <START:location> Belgrade <END> , the Serbian capital , but to <START:location> Sofia <END> , where more tech money resides .
“ While there was a community in <START:location> Belgrade <END> , there was already an ecosystem in <START:location> Sofia <END> , ” said <START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> , the company ’s chief executive .
The firm has received €200,000 from <START:organization> Eleven <END> , an accelerator fund that offers a training and mentorship program in return for a stake in the companies it supports .
The <START:organization> VetCloud <END> team spent three months in <START:location> Bulgaria <END> , learning the nuts and bolts of starting and running a tech company .
“We got the money and advice we needed , ” <START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> said .
<START:organization> Launchub <END> and <START:organization> Eleven <END> manage a total of €21 million as part of a European Union-sponsored initiative to support small and midsize businesses , named <START:organization> Jeremie <END> .
They have distributed €9 million among 120 start-ups from the region in the past two years and plan to fund around 200 firms by 2015 .
In comparison , German and international venture capitalists in <START:location> Berlin <END> invested €133 million in start-ups in 2012 , according to a <START:organization> McKinsey <END> study from last year .
But a small amount of funding goes a long way in the <START:location> Balkans <END> , where costs for starting a business are much lower than those in <START:location> Berlin <END> or <START:location> London <END> .
Entrepreneurs have had to overcome the long tradition of outsourcing in the Balkans to want to work for themselves and come up with the next must-have app or big e-business success .
<START:person> Milos Milic <END> , a 25-year-old Serbian IT developer , is part of the new generation .
Last December , he and his business partner , <START:person> Srdjan Stupar <END> , quit their jobs to start <START:organization> Farmia <END> , an online exchange for livestock .
<START:person> Mr. Milic <END> described the change as the best thing that has ever happened to him .
“We have smaller salaries now , but we have a chance to build our own company , ” he said .
Until recently , Serbian start-ups had to look abroad for financing .
But funds like <START:organization> StartLabs <END> , launched last year , aim to fill this gap , offering funding of up to $ 50,000 and connecting firms with mentors and foreign investors .
“This is the best time to start something like this , ” said <START:person> Nebojsa Lazic <END> , the <START:organization> StartLabs <END> ’ general partner .
Things have changed , he added , since the days when entrepreneurs were half-jokingly called “superheroes with suicidal tendencies” .
Unlike <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> companies , which have access to hundreds of millions of consumers in the <START:location> United States <END> alone , Balkan firms are based in a region fragmented into small markets .
But <START:person> Dilyan Dimitrov <END> , one of <START:organization> Eleven’s <END> founders , says this can be a plus as it forces regional start-ups to develop ideas with broader appeal .
“Everyone who is starting a tech product is very much aware that they have to make a global-scalable product , ” he said .
<START:organization> Playground Energy <END> , based in <START:location> Sofia <END> , is trying to do exactly that .
The company makes playground equipment that generates electricity from children’s play .
The electricity powers lights , sounds and other effects to encourage the children to play longer .
The company ’s co-founder , <START:person> Hristo Alexiev <END> , says that being based in <START:locatiojn> Bulgaria <END> gives the company significant advantages .
It can pursue a strategy of global growth while using local designers and developers .
That keeps costs low , making the most of the €200,000 it has secured in investment .
“If we moved to <START:location> America <END> , we’d have spent half of the money just on the move , rent , lawyers , ” said <START:person> Mr. Alexiev <END> , who , at 44 , talks about <START:organization> Playground Energy <END> , his sixth start-up , with the enthusiasm of a 17-year-old launching his first business .
But others have chosen a different path , moving to <START:location> London <END> or <START:location> Berlin <END> , where they believe they can grow faster .
<START:organization> Unioncy <END> , an online platform designed to let people keep track of their purchases and store their warranties , bills , insurance and manuals all in one place , moved from <START:location> Sofia <END> to <START:location> London <END> , where they found more investment opportunities .
But <START:organization> Unioncy’s <END> fate shows that moving to a big tech hub is no guarantee of success .
The business quickly went from start-up to shutdown , announcing its demise at the end of October due to “larger than anticipated technical challenges . ”
<START:organization> VetCloud <END> , the Serbian start-up , also established a presence in <START:location> London <END> after receiving financing and mentoring from the British office of <START:organization> TechStars <END> , an international fund .
“We decided to move where our market is , ” said <START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> .
While start-ups in the <START:location> Balkans <END> hope for a big breakthrough , one nearby ex-communist country has already scored a string of international successes .
<START:location> Hungary <END> was the launch pad for companies including <START:organization> Prezi <END> , the popular cloud-based presentation software ; Ustream , a live video-streaming platform ; and <START:organization> LogMeIn <END> , which gives users remote access to their computers .
<START:organization> Prezi <END> was created in 2009 as an alternative to <START:organization> Microsoft’s <END> ubiquitous <START:organization> PowerPoint <END> .
Five years later , it has 45 million users around the world .
For a co-founder , <START:person> Peter Halacsy <END> , the key to start-up success is “not the money , it ’s not the infrastructure , not the legal system ” but changing the way people think — getting away from a stuffy , risk-averse , communist-era mentality .
Along with <START:organization> Ustream <END> and <START:organization> LogMeIn <END> , <START:organization> Prezi <END> created a nongovernmental organization called <START:organization> Bridge Budapest <END> that aims to help and inspire a new generation of Hungarian entrepreneurs .
“ Here , parents tell their kids : ‘Don’t try , it ’s risky .
Go work in a bank , that would be better for you , " ’ said <START:person> Veronika Pistyur <END> , the organization’s chief executive .
“Now I can see that more and more people are willing to try . ”
But , so far , newer Hungarian start-ups have not managed to reach the same level of success as <START:organization> Prezi <END> and the other established stars of <START:location> Budapest’s <END> tech scene .
Back in the <START:location> Balkans <END> , investors are under no illusions that the region will become another <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , but some say it could still play a worthwhile role in the international tech scene .
“ What can develop here is a kind of incubator for talents — places that yield people with interesting ideas , ” said <START:person> Maxim Gurvits <END> , a partner at Sofia-based <START:organization> Teres Capital <END> , which plans to start a venture capital fund to invest in startups in Central and Eastern <START:location> Europe <END> .
“So , the next time you want to create a company , you go to <START:location> Sofia <END> , not <START:location> New York <END> , because it ’s very expensive there . ”
While the <START:location> Balkans <END> may have plenty of coders , investors say the shortage of people with business experience is a serious disadvantage .
For <START:person> Mr. Belov <END> , from <START:organization> Launchub <END> , “the only way to have a big success is to have the developers here but the sales and marketing outsourced to places where those skills are developed to perfection , like <START:location> London <END> and <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> . ”
Some tech entrepreneurs also want more immediate and practical help .
Some point to the example of the British government , which offers big tax breaks to investors in start-ups and the companies themselves .
“All start-ups need tax benefits and a more relaxed tax system during the first year or two , ” said <START:person> Danica Radisic <END> , a Belgrade-based entrepreneur .
Despite current obstacles , the coders keep working on their big ideas .
In addition to its launch in <START:location> Britain <END> , <START:organization> VetCloud <END> has been negotiating partnerships with distributors in the <START:location> United States <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Vesic <END> dreams big .
“If you use <START:organization> Dropbox <END> to sync your files , if you use <START:organization> Google <END> to search the Internet , you’ll use <START:organization> VetCloud <END> to manage vets ’ medical records , ” he said .

<START:location> WASHINGTON <END> — When <START:person> President Obama <END> laid out his vision for strict regulation of Internet access last month , he was voicing views thought to be held by many at the most liberal end of the <START:organization> Democratic Party <END> .
A few days later , however , the <START:organization> N.A.A.C.P. <END> , the <START:organization> National Urban League <END> and the <START:organization> Rainbow/PUSH Coalition <END> sent representatives , including the <START:person> Rev. Jesse L. Jackson <END> , to tell <START:person> Tom Wheeler <END> , chairman of the <START:organization> Federal Communications Commission <END> , that they thought <START:person> Mr. Obama’s <END> call to regulate broadband Internet service as a utility would harm minority communities by stifling investment in underserved areas and entrenching already dominant Internet companies .
Their displeasure should not be read as a sign that most civil rights organizations were unhappy with <START:person> Mr. Obama’s <END> plan , however .
When it comes to the details of Internet regulation , groups that otherwise have much common ground simply don’t see eye to eye .
<START:organization> ColorofChange .org <END> , a black political coalition , and the <START:organization> National Hispanic Media Coalition <END> , for example , support treating Internet access as an essential service like electricity or water — as <START:person> Mr. Obama <END> proposed — while the <START:organization> League of United Latin American Citizens <END> opposes it .
“The civil rights community is like every sector anywhere .
While from the outside it seems like a monolith , it is not , ” said <START:person> Cheryl A. Leanza <END> , a policy adviser for the <START:organization> United Church of Christ <END> <START:organization> Office of Communication <END> .
Though she was part of the 11-member group that included <START:person> Mr. Jackson <END> , she asked the chairman to embrace the president ’s plan .
The debate is but one slice of a huge campaign to lobby the five <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> commissioners as they weigh net neutrality , the concept that all Internet traffic should be treated equally , and whether to reclassify broadband as a more heavily regulated service .
Since 2002 , broadband has been classified as a Title I information service under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , meaning that the <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> lightly regulates it .
Title II services include “common carriers ” like telephone companies , whose rates the <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> can regulate and whose business plans often require the commission’s approval .
In May , <START:person> Mr. Wheeler <END> made a proposal that would allow companies to pay Internet providers to give them a “fast lane ” to consumers .
<START:person> Mr. Wheeler <END> is against that practice , known as paid prioritization , and he said his proposal would discourage it .
But the regulatory outline released by the <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> would still allow for paid prioritization in some circumstances , a loophole that was seized on by opponents .
<START:person> President Obama <END> urged the <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> to reclassify broadband as a Title II service , which would generally give the commission the authority to prohibit broadband providers from blocking or discriminating against legal online content .
In the four weeks since <START:person> Mr. Obama’s <END> move , over 100 companies , industry groups and coalitions have met with commissioners and their staffs .
At least 67 of those groups have met with <START:person> Mr. Wheeler <END> himself — nearly four a day , on average .
Included in those meetings have been civil rights groups with surprisingly divergent views .
The unusual alignments can also be seen in urban governments .
The cities of <START:location> Baltimore <END> , <START:location> Chicago <END> , <START:location> Los Angeles <END> and <START:location> San Francisco <END> sent representatives to meet with <START:person> Mr. Wheeler’s <END> advisers to say they agreed with tight regulation , but that view is opposed by the <START:organization> National Organization of Blacks in Government <END> .
“ I think we’re all on board with the values embedded in what <START:person> President Obama <END> said , things like accelerating broadband deployment and adoption , ” said <START:person> Nicol Turner-Lee <END> , vice president of the <START:organization> Minority Media and Telecommunications Council <END> and a member of the group including <START:person> Mr. Jackson <END> that met with the <START:organization> F.C.C. <END> chairman .
“The question is , will we be able to solve these issues by going so far with stringent regulation ? ”
Some of the groups that oppose Title II designation , like the <START:organization> Urban League <END> and the <START:organization> League of United Latin American Citizens <END> , have received contributions from organizations affiliated with Internet service providers , like the <START:organization> Comcast <END> Foundation , the charitable organization endowed by <START:organization> Comcast <END> .
Parts of the <START:organization> Rainbow/PUSH Coalition’s <END> annual symposium on civil rights were conducted last week at <START:organization> Comcast’s <END> offices in <START:location> Washington <END> .
But those organizations say that the donations or sponsorships do not influence their positions .
“We get support from people on all sides of the issue , including <START:organization> Google <END> and <START:organization> Facebook <END> , ” said <START:person> Brent A. Wilkes <END> , national executive director of the <START:organization> League of United Latin American Citizens <END> .
“We don’t let any of them influence our position . ”
Several of those favoring Title II , meanwhile , have received funding from organizations affiliated with companies that support stronger regulation .
The <START:organization> National Hispanic Media Coalition <END> conducts events that are sponsored in part by companies like <START:organization> Google <END> and <START:organization> Facebook <END> .
A trade organization sponsored by those and other Internet companies , the Internet Association , supports a shift to stricter regulation .
<START:person> Jessica Gonzalez <END> , executive vice president of the <START:organization> National Hispanic Media Coalition <END> , said her organization also received support from <START:organization> Comcast <END> for some of its programs .
“There is a clear separation between our policy work and who funds us , ” she said .
One of the primary disagreements among the civil rights groups is over a practice known as “zero rating , ” in which an Internet service provider makes a deal with a content provider like <START:organization> Facebook <END> or <START:organization> Spotify <END> to allow consumers unlimited access to that service without its counting against a cap on data usage .
Because zero-rating plans are most common among mobile broadband providers , those plans could particularly affect minority communities , <START:person> Ms. Turner-Lee <END> said , which are more likely to depend on mobile systems for Internet access .
It is not entirely clear how <START:person> Mr. Obama’s <END> plan would affect zero-rated apps .
“The relevant question is whether there is something to be said about zero-rating plans and the ways that they can be used to further Internet adoption , ” <START:person> Ms. Turner-Lee <END> said , adding that her group had not yet taken a stance .
But critics say that zero-rating programs are just a form of paid prioritization that could further entrench companies like <START:organization> Facebook <END> that have the financial muscle to pay for the privilege .
According to the Mobile Trends Charging Report by <START:organization> Allot Communications <END> , nearly half of mobile broadband providers worldwide offer at least one zero-rated app , and two-thirds of those offer <START:organization> Facebook <END> as one .
The alignment of civil rights groups both for and against <START:person> Mr. Obama’s <END> recommendation for net-neutrality enforcement is not the only oddity in this debate .
In 2005 , the <START:organization> Supreme Court <END> ruled that the F.C.C. acted within the law when it classified cable broadband as a lightly regulated information service .
Writing a stinging dissent to that decision — that is , saying that broadband was obviously more like a utility — was an otherwise frequent nemesis of Democrats : <START:person> Justice Antonin Scalia <END> .

<START:person> Ralph H. Baer <END> , who turned television sets into electronic fantasy lands by inventing and patenting the first home video game system , died on Saturday at his home in <START:location> Manchester , N.H. <END>
He was 92 .
His death was confirmed by his family .
Video games have become more than just a ubiquitous pastime and a gigantic market ( by some estimates , total worldwide sales of console hardware and software and online , mobile and computer games exceeded $ 90 billion in 2013 ) .
They are also an engine that has driven scientists and engineers to multiply computer speed , memory and visualization to today’s staggering capabilities .
Flash back to the sultry late summer of 1966 : <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> is sitting on a step outside the <START:organization> Port Authority <END> Bus Terminal in <START:location> Manhattan <END> waiting for a colleague .
By profession , he is an engineer overseeing 500 employees at a military contractor .
Today , a vision has gripped him , and he begins scribbling furiously on a yellow legal pad with a No. 2 pencil .
The result was a detailed four-page outline for a “game box ” that would allow people to play board , action , sports and other games on almost any American television set .
An intrigued boss gave him $ 2,000 for research and $ 500 for materials and assigned two men to work with him .
For all three , as they plowed through prototype after prototype in a secret workshop , the project became an obsession .
In March 1971 , <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> and his employer , <START:organization> Sanders Associates <END> in <START:location> Nashua , N.H. <END> , filed for the first video game patent , which was granted in April 1973 as Patent No. 3,728,480 .
It made an extraordinarily large claim to a legal monopoly for any product that included a domestic television with circuits capable of producing and controlling dots on a screen .
<START:organization> Sanders Associates <END> licensed its system to <START:organization> Magnavox <END> , which began selling it as <START:organization> Odyssey <END> in the summer of 1972 as the first home video game console .
It sold 130,000 units the first year .
<START:organization> Odyssey <END> consisted of a master control unit containing all the electronic gear , two player control units that directed players on the TV screen , and a set of electronic program cards , each of which supported a different game .
Plastic overlays that clung to the screen to supply color were included .
To supplement the electronic action , a deck of playing cards , poker chips and a pair of dice were included .
But the guts of the device were what mattered : 40 transistors and 40 diodes .
That hardware ran everything .
<START:organization> Odyssey <END> , often called the first home computing device , had no software .
Several months after <START:organization> Odyssey <END> hit the market , <START:organization> Atari <END> came out with the first arcade video game , <START:organization> Pong <END> .
Though <START:organization> Pong <END> became better known than <START:organization> Odyssey <END> and was in some ways more agile , <START:organization> Sanders <END> and <START:organization> Magnavox <END> immediately saw it as an infringement on their patent .
They sued <START:organization> Atari <END> in 1974 for usurping their rights .
<START:organization> Atari <END> settled with them by paying $ 700,000 to become <START:organization> Odyssey’s <END> second licensee .
Over the next 20 years , <START:organization> Magnavox <END> went on to sue dozens more companies , winning more than $ 100 million .
<START:person> Mr. Baer <END> often testified .
<START:organization> “Magnavox <END> is n’t in the business of making video games , ” <START:person> Howard Lincoln <END> , <START:organization> Nintendo’s <END> vice president and senior counsel , groused in an interview with <START:organization> Newsday <END> in 1989 .
“They’re just in the business of suing people . ”
( <START:organization> Nintendo <END> , like all the game makers <START:organization> Magnavox <END> challenged , lost . )
<START:person> Mr. Baer’s <END> contraption represented the beginnings of a change in man’s relationship with machines .
<START:person> Harold Goldberg <END> , in his book “All Your Base Are Belong to Us : How Fifty Years of Videogames Conquered Pop Culture ” ( 2011 ) , said <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> made television “an extension of you , the player . ”
“It would let you interact with a square on a black-and-white screen , and if you had even the lamest imagination , it made you believe you were volleying at tennis , aiming carefully as a brave marksman , even playing the innocent as you saved lives , ” <START:person> Mr. Goldberg <END> wrote .
The roots of video games go back to universities and research laboratories .
Some experts cite <START:person> William A. Higinbotham’s <END> <START:organization> Tennis for Two <END> , invented in 1958 at <START:organization> Brookhaven National Laboratory <END> , as the first interactive computer game .
“ When technology is ready for something novel , when the components needed to build something new become affordable , it is going to be done by someone and more likely by several people , ” wrote <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> , who said he had never seen <START:organization> Tennis for Two <END> .
From <START:person> Mr. Baer’s <END> modestly named “brown box ” have sprung <START:organization> PlayStation <END> , <START:organization> Xbox <END> and <START:organization> Wii <END> , all products of the ceaseless revolution in microprocessing .
Two technical paths merged to power this revolution .
One was computer science ; the other was <START:person> Mr. Baer’s <END> field of expertise , television engineering .
<START:person> Mr. Baer <END> had more than 150 <START:location> United States <END> and foreign patents , and his contributions ranged from talking doormats and greeting cards to submarine tracking systems .
In 2006 , <START:person> President George W. Bush <END> awarded him the National Medal of Technology .
In 2010 , he was admitted to the <START:organization> National Inventors Hall of Fame <END> .
Along with <START:person> Howard Morrison <END> , he invented the electronic game <START:organization> Simon <END> , which was introduced at <START:organization> Studio 54 <END> in <START:location> Manhattan <END> in 1978 and became a pop culture phenomenon in the 1980s .
A saucer-shaped plastic toy with four colored buttons , it lit up and emitted tones in a sequence that the player then had to reproduce .
It is still being sold .
“Coming up with novel ideas and converting them into real products has always been as natural as breathing for me , ” <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> wrote in his 2005 autobiography , “Videogames : In the Beginning . ”
<START:person> Ralph Henry Baer <END> was born on March 8 , 1922 , into a Jewish family in <START:location> Pirmasens , Germany <END> , where his father worked in a shoe factory .
His family emigrated to <START:location> New York <END> in 1938 to escape <START:person> Hitler <END> and settled in the <START:location> Bronx <END> .
Within a week , <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> , then 16 , was working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. in a factory that made leather cases for manicure kits .
He soon invented a machine to speed the process by stitching five or six at once .
One day on the subway he noticed an advertisement in a magazine somebody else was reading .
“Make big money in radio and television servicing , ” it said .
So <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> spent a quarter of his $ 12 in wages every week on a correspondence course .
He finished in a few months , then took the advanced course .
He quit the factory after two years and fixed radios .
He was drafted into the <START:organization> Army <END> in 1943 and became an intelligence officer .
He served in <START:location> Europe <END> during World War II , and in his spare time studied algebra and made radios from German mine detectors so his friends could listen to music .
Trained to be an expert in small arms , he collected 18 tons of German weapons , which were exhibited at military museums in the <START:location> United States <END> .
After the war , <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> attended the <START:organization> American Television Institute of Technology <END> in <START:location> Chicago <END> , where he earned one of the first bachelor’s degrees in television engineering .
He then worked for a company that made surgical cutting machines , before joining <START:organization> Loral Electronics <END> in the <START:location> Bronx <END> as a senior engineer .
Assigned to design a state-of-the art television set in 1951 , he suggested adding a game-playing feature .
“Forget it , ” he recalled his boss saying .
“ Just build the damn TV set ; you’re behind schedule as it is . ”
In 1956 <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> joined <START:organization> Sanders <END> , where he advanced to division manager .
As he pursued military projects like electronic devices to teach weapons aiming , his mind returned to the idea of a TV set with a game feature .
Those musings led to his eureka moment at the <START:location> New York <END> bus station .
Still , he said in 2007 , the common reaction of most <START:organization> Sanders <END> executives was , “Are you still screwing around with that stuff ? ”
One top boss , however , saw potential in <START:person> Mr. Baer’s <END> idea .
He assigned two engineers , <START:person> Bill Harrison <END> and <START:person> Bill Rusch <END> , to work with him , and gave the three $ 2,500 to spend .
In a tiny room <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> described as an attic , they worked in secret , building seven prototypes .
<START:organization> Sanders <END> first tried to license it to pay-TV companies , the forerunners of today’s cable systems , but found no takers .
Television manufacturers were also lukewarm .
<START:organization> RCA <END> expressed interest but backed out .
<START:organization> Magnavox <END> then signed on .
The <START:organization> Odyssey <END> had sold some 330,000 units by 1975 , but <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> thought it could have sold many more .
He blamed <START:organization> Magnavox <END> for limiting sales to its own dealers , giving the false impression that the system worked only on <START:organization> Magnavox <END> sets .
He also criticized the company for pricing it at $ 100 , rather than the $ 19.95 he recommended .
<START:organization> Odyssey <END> nonetheless represented a critical point .
Along with <START:organization> Atari’s <END> <START:organization> Pong, <END> which had more advanced electronics and sound , it moved games into a faster , more complex realm , to the delight of an eager new audience .
The accomplishment , <START:person> Mr. Baer <END> wrote , would amount to far more than just fun and games .
“If it weren’t for video game enthusiasts and the absolute commercial need to keep them happy with ever-better graphics requiring ever-higher processor speeds , complex computer graphics would still be found only in the high-priced domains of the business and science world , ” he said .
In an interview , <START:person> Keith Feinstein <END> , a video game historian , called <START:person> Mr. Baer’s <END> invention “the beginning of a revolution in thought . ”
<START:person> Mr. Baer <END> retired from <START:organization> Sanders <END> in 1987 and started his own consulting business .
<START:person> Mr. Baer <END> is survived by two sons , <START:person> James <END> and <START:person> Mark <END> ; a daughter , <START:person> Nancy Baer <END> ; and four grandchildren .
His wife of 53 years , the former <START:person> Dena Whinston <END> , died in 2006 .
<START:person> Mr. Baer <END> donated his collection of early game hardware to several museums , including the <START:organization> Smithsonian Institution <END> .

He keeps grade cards for every member of Congress , deploys three million activists to blast lawmakers with anti-immigration telephone calls , faxes and emails , and runs a website where his followers have called undocumented immigrants “criminal invaders ” and “wolves at the door . ”
But for <START:person> Roy H. Beck <END> , perhaps the most powerful member of the small but vocal movement that has helped scuttle every effort at an immigration overhaul for nearly two decades , the fight is only beginning .
Over the next year , his goal is to cut off funding for President Obama’s executive actions that have shielded up to five million people from deportation and will allow many of them work permits .
“There’s a good chance that we’ll roll back a good share of this , ” <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> , 66 , said in a recent interview in his <START:location> Rosslyn , Va. <END> , office , a mostly threadbare space with sweeping views of the <START:location> Potomac River <END> and the <START:location> Capitol <END> dome .
“We did as much as possible to make immigration radioactive in as many places as possible . ”
As the founder and president of <START:organization> NumbersUSA <END> , <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> has 35 staff members and an annual budget of about $ 10 million compared with a coalition of immigrant groups that spent $ 1.5 billion from 2008 to 2012 lobbying for an array of immigration changes , according to an estimate by the nonpartisan <START:organization> Sunlight Foundation <END> .
But what <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> lacks in resources , he makes up for in impact .
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> and his group “have succeeded in thwarting the passage of comprehensive immigration reform by generating popular anger on the right that overwhelmed mainstream Republicans , ” said <START:person> Frank Sharry <END> of <START:organization> America’s Voice <END> , an advocacy group pressing for such an overhaul .
At the very least , immigration advocates say , they will have to fight the grass-roots uproar that <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> has fueled .
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> , a former environmental journalist who once worked at <START:organization> The Grand Rapids Press <END> and <START:organization> The Cincinnati Enquirer <END> , said he did not feel the rage toward immigrants that he is able to marshal in others .
He said that he voted for <START:person> Mr. Obama <END> in 2008 , and he is consistently described by his critics as genial and nonconfrontational .
But he says that the rise in immigration levels is destroying the <START:location> United States <END> — both the environment and employment opportunities for the working class — and is angry at what he considers complicity by the government on the immigrants ’ behalf .
While the country once admitted about 250,000 legal immigrants annually , he said , the number has ballooned to one million , which does not include those who come illegally .
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> is pressing to cut legal immigration to 500,000 people a year .
“This has nothing to do with the immigrants themselves , ” <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> said .
“ But are the people who are here illegally more important than the Americans , the people of this national community , who have absolutely been robbed of their dignity ? ”
Despite his disclaimers , <START:person> Mr. Beck’s <END> critics say he is pushing a xenophobic agenda and is the benign face of a racist movement .
“ He’s played footsie with extremists all along , ” said <START:person> Heidi Beirich <END> , the director of the <START:organization> Southern Poverty Law Center <END> ’s <START:organization> Intelligence Project <END> , which tracks hate groups .
Even as she described <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> as a “completely nice guy , ” <START:person> Ms. Beirich <END> said that “in a way , what Beck does is , he provides cover for the bad guys . ”
The criticism stems from <START:person> Mr. Beck’s <END> connection to <START:person> John H. Tanton <END> , a <START:location> Michigan <END> ophthalmologist who helped start and finance <START:organization> NumbersUSA <END> and has nurtured two other groups , the <START:organization> Federation for American Immigration Reform <END> and the <START:organization> Center for Immigration Studies <END> , which share <START:person> Mr. Beck’s <END> commitment to reducing immigration .
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> described him as “one of the grand environmental leaders , ” but <START:person> Mr. Tanton <END> has also been accused of pushing a white nationalist agenda , and he once wrote of his fear of a “Latino onslaught . ”
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> said that his group had been independent of <START:person> Mr. Tanton <END> for a dozen years , and he went out of his way to deny charges of racism .
He has a “No to Immigrant Bashing ” section on the <START:organization> NumbersUSA <END> website urging civil discourse , and said he filtered out user comments that contain overtly racist terms .
He has also posted a photograph of <START:person> Barbara Jordan <END> , a <START:location> Texas <END> congresswoman and civil rights leader who was the chairwoman of an immigration commission he advised in 1996 , doing so in part , <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> said , to ward off racist members .
“If you’re a white supremacy group , that ’s sort of a signal to you that , ‘This is not our group , ’ ” <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> said .
Tax disclosures filed in 2013 show that <START:organization> NumbersUSA <END> received about $ 4.5 million from the <START:organization> Colcom Foundation <END> , a Pittsburgh-based organization founded by <START:person> Cordelia Scaife May <END> , the <START:organization> Mellon <END> banking heiress .
The foundation says it works to combat overpopulation ; the <START:organization> Southern Poverty Law Center <END> says the foundation funds hate groups with “nativist ” missions .
The foundation’s vice president of philanthropy is <START:person> John F. Rohe <END> , a <START:organization> Tanton <END> loyalist and biographer .
<START:organization> Numbers USA <END> , <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> said , has “always stayed away from cultural issues . ”
From his earliest days , <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> focused on numbers .
Now the father of two adult sons , he was raised in <START:location> Marshfield <END> , a town of 2,500 in <START:location> Missouri’s Ozarks <END> , where he delivered milk and collected cans to make pocket money .
After journalism school at the <START:organization> University of Missouri <END> , <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> became interested in immigration while covering the birth of the environmental movement in the late 1960s , as concern grew about the consequences of population growth on natural resources .
Disillusioned when he thought immigration was not receiving sufficient attention , he left journalism in the 1990s to write books , and later decided to start <START:organization> Numbers USA <END> .
He began with a video , recorded on VHS tape in 1996 , in which he used a huge container of colored gumballs to illustrate the billions of people living in third world countries , and a small glass snifter to portray the <START:location> United States <END> , taking in millions more immigrants , one gumball at a time .
The gumballs are still in his office , but on a recent afternoon , he left them behind and instead took PowerPoint slides to make his arguments to a group of students from <START:organization> Grinnell College <END> in <START:location> Iowa <END> who are spending a semester in <START:location> Washington <END> .
“At the end , unless somebody’s watching the numbers , you end up with a problem , ” <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> told the group .
“It sounds horrible , does n’t it ? ”
<START:person> Mr. Beck <END> conceded of his group ’s position that immigration should be sharply curtailed and strict new workplace screenings instituted , so any undocumented worker is immediately laid off .
“People say , ‘Boy that ’s really mean — it ’s so mean — because you’re making that person who has a job lose a job , ’ ” <START:person> Mr. Beck <END> told his young audience .
“And yet , as long as they’re in that job , what’s the meanest thing of all ?
The Americans that don’t have that job . ”

The <START:organization> Senate Banking Committee <END> plans to hold a hearing next week on ways to “protect the financial sector ” from cyberattacks , but for now there are no plans to have anyone from the financial services industry testify .
The hearing set for Wednesday will feature testimony from top officials of the <START:organization> Federal Bureau of Investigation <END> , the <START:organization> Secret Service <END> , the <START:organization> Treasury Department <END> , the <START:organization> Department of Homeland Security <END> and the <START:organization> Office of the Comptroller of the Currency <END> .
The banking committee is holding the hearing in the aftermath of this summer ’s big cyberattack at <START:organization> JPMorgan Chase <END> that compromised some account information of 83 million households and small businesses .
Law enforcement officials have said the same hackers that breached <START:organization> JPMorgan’s <END> systems also tried to gain access to the systems of at least a dozen other financial institutions .
In October , the banking committee sent a letter to five regulators seeking information about how they were coordinating their work with law enforcement agencies in responding to attacks on the financial system .
They were also asked whether legislative proposals were needed to foster a better working relationship .
The letter specifically noted the attack on <START:organization> JPMorgan <END> and the need to make sure that government agencies the private institutions work together to maintain the “integrity of the financial system . ”
A person briefed on the matter said the hearing would focus on how the various government agencies were working together to deal with cyberattacks on banks and other financial institutions .
It’s not clear how much of the testimony will discuss the attack on JPMorgan or any other specific financial institution .
<START:person> Patricia Wexler <END> , a <START:organization> JPMorgan <END> spokeswoman , said the bank had not been asked to provide the committee with any information in advance of the hearing .
A spokeswoman for the <START:location> Connecticut <END> attorney general , <START:person> George Jepsen <END> , whose office is overseeing an investigation by several state attorneys generals into the <START:organization> JPMorgan <END> breach , said the state office had not been contacted by the <START:organization> Senate <END> committee .
In the <START:organization> JPMorgan <END> attack , the bank has said it found no evidence of any fraud or misuse of customer information .
<START:organization> JPMorgan <END> said the hackers got access only to customer email addresses , homes addresses and phone numbers but nothing of a more sensitive nature like Social Security numbers .
Over the past several years , cyberattacks on financial institutions have become a matter of increasing concern for regulators who are worried about criminals getting access to sensitive customer financial information or looting accounts .
To date , the most serious attacks have taken place in retail , with hackers attempting to get access to credit card account number by breaching the systems at companies like <START:organization> Target <END> and <START:organization> Home Depot <END> .

SINCE the feature first became available five years ago , the ability to deposit a check with a few taps on a smartphone has become one of the most popular features of mobile banking .
While the systems generally run smoothly , some possible drawbacks are becoming evident as use of the service grows .
Last year , the <START:organization> Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation <END> reported , about three-quarters of the largest banks offered mobile check deposit — known as “remote deposit capture ” in banking lingo .
The service , which lets customers use a mobile app to snap a photo of checks with their phones or tablets and deposit the money in their bank accounts , was used by about 11 percent of consumers a year ago , up from 2 percent in 2011 , according to a new report from the <START:organization> Pew Charitable Trusts <END> .
As the service catches on , it becomes increasingly important for customers to compare the terms of mobile deposit services that different banks offer — but that comparison is n’t always easy to do , since disclosures by banks vary and are sometimes vague or incomplete , according to the <START:organization> Pew <END> report .
“Consumers can’t readily comparison-shop based on terms and conditions , ” said <START:person> Susan Weinstock <END> , director of <START:organization> Pew’s <END> consumer banking project .
Some banks , for instance , don’t offer immediate availability of funds deposited by smartphone , as a way to control fraud .
Banks also impose limits on the amounts that can be deposited using mobile phones , also to protect against fraud .
But it can be difficult to find that information ; some banks put such information online , rather than within the app that customers use to deposit the checks , <START:organization> Pew <END> found .
While it ’s so far been relatively limited , fraud can occur with mobile check deposit , partly because unlike with traditional check deposits , the customer retains the original paper check , which can be redeposited — either by accident or intentionally .
A study by <START:organization> Celent <END> of more than 200 banks found an uptick in fraud related to remote deposits as use of the service grows .
Each year from 2010 through 2012 , nearly 90 percent of banks said they had no losses attributable to remote deposit , but that proportion dropped to more than three-quarters of banks in 2013 .
So far , however , banks generally consider the losses that occur with mobile deposits to be “manageable , ” <START:person> Bob Meara <END> , a senior banking analyst at <START:organization> Celent <END> , said .
That’s not to say that some consumers have n’t run into problems .
<START:person> Katherine Kostreva <END> , a marketing and public relations consultant in <START:location> New York <END> , said she had encountered problems with mobile check deposits at <START:organization> Bank of America <END> this year — first for $ 1,400 and then for $ 1,200 .
In both cases , the bank concluded that the checks deposited with her mobile app were later deposited or cashed a second time at different banks .
As a result , <START:organization> Bank of America <END> withdrew the funds that had been deposited in her account .
She said that she had been a victim of fraud , and that the paper checks deposited at the other banks were stolen from her .
She has been talking with the bank about the return of the money .
Here are some questions about mobile check deposit :
■ How should I sign my check when using mobile deposit ?
Check with your bank for its specific requirements .
In general , adding the phrase “for mobile deposit only ” is a good idea , said <START:person> James DeBello <END> , chief of <START:organization> Mitek <END> , which provides the systems that process mobile check deposits at many banks .
That helps reduce the chance that someone could — intentionally or by accident — try to cash or redeposit the check .
<START:organization> Mitek <END> now offers banks the ability to scan checks for the presence of such “restrictive endorsements , ” to reduce the risk of multiple deposits , <START:person> Mr. DeBello <END> said .
■ How long should I keep a paper check after I’ve deposited it using my phone ?
Each bank has its own rules , which may vary widely , the <START:organization> Pew <END> report found .
Some banks require that the customer destroy the check as soon as the funds appear in the account ; other banks require checks to be held for up to 90 days , and at least one implies that checks should be held “indefinitely . ”
You should follow your bank’s rules , and keep the check in a safe place after you deposit it .
<START:person> Al Pascual <END> of <START:organization> Javelin Strategy & Research <END> said that after depositing checks with mobile apps , consumers should treat them “like cash ” until their bank’s required holding period expires .
■ How soon after I deposit a check using my phone are funds available to me ?
The rules for availability of funds from mobile deposits may vary from those for checks deposited by traditional means , the <START:organization> Pew <END> report found ; some banks offer immediate access to funds , but may charge a fee for the service .

In a twist on how <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> companies are financed , several technology luminaries have banded together to effectively do the work of a traditional venture capital firm .
The <START:organization> Microsoft <END> co-founder <START:person> Bill Gates <END> , <START:organization> Yahoo <END> co-founder <START:person> Jerry Yang <END> , <START:organization> Twitter <END> co-founder <START:person> Evan Williams <END> and others have invested $ 25 million in <START:organization> Change .org <END> , the petitions website , to help it expand .
Others in the group include prominent business leaders like the billionaire <START:person> Richard Branson <END> , <START:organization> eBay <END> founder <START:person> Pierre M. Omidyar <END> and <START:organization> LinkedIn <END> co-founder <START:person> Reid Hoffman <END> .
In all , two dozen investors are contributing $ 250,000 to a few million dollars each .
“It would have been a lot more straightforward to raise money from a single institution , ” said <START:person> Ben Rattray <END> , <START:organization> Change .org’s <END>
chief executive .
“ But we had a group of people who are passionate about our mission and who had experience building global enterprises , who we can turn to for advice . ”
<START:organization> Change .org <END> lets users create online petitions that call on governments and companies to act on specific issues .
One recent campaign , begun after <START:location> Michael Brown <END> ’s death , calls for police in <START:location> St . Louis County <END> , the city of <START:location> St . Louis <END> and <START:location> Ferguson , Mo. <END> , where <START:person> Mr. Brown <END> was killed , to wear body cameras .
It quickly received more than 130,000 signatures .
Another campaign , started after <START:organization> Unilever <END> sued a start-up food company that makes a mayonnaise alternative , called for big companies to “stop bullying sustainable food companies . ”
It garnered more than 100,000 supporters in less than a month .
<START:organization> Change .org <END> had already raised nearly $ 20 million , most of it in a $ 15 million fund-raising round last year .
The new infusion of $ 25 million will be used to expand the company ’s engineering team , invest in mobile development and expand a tool that allows the businesses and politicians who are the targets of petitions to engage with users .
“We want a world where elected representatives can openly and authentically connect with their constituents at scale , ” <START:person> Mr. Rattray <END> said .
Among <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> start-ups , <START:organization> Change .org <END>
has a reputation for being a progressive , mission-driven company .
Despite having a dot-org web suffix , it is a for-profit company .
But it is a benefit , or B , corporation , a distinction that allows it to make decisions based on what is good for society , not just what is good for its shareholders .
This year , for example , <START:organization> Change .org <END> announced a generous new parental leave policy for its employees .
“B corps are different than traditional corporations in that they have higher standards of social and environmental performance , accountability and transparency , ” said <START:person> Andrew Kassoy <END> , a co-founder of <START:organization> B Lab <END> , which certifies such companies .
Other start-ups including <START:organization> Etsy <END> and <START:organization> Kickstarter <END> are B corporations .
And divisions of some big public companies , like <START:organization> Ben & Jerry’s <END> , which is owned by <START:organization> Unilever <END> , have received the certification .
<START:organization> Change .org <END> did not say how much investors estimated the company was worth with this latest round of financing .
Though many prominent start-ups have been pegged as being worth tens of billions of dollars , <START:person> Mr. Rattray <END> played down the importance of Silicon Valley companies chasing higher valuations .
“Some C.E.O.s become overly focused on building the valuation , instead of building the company , ” he said .
“We want the proxy for our success to be the victories of our campaigns . ”
More than 80 million people worldwide are using the site .
A majority of new users are from abroad .
This year , a petition to spare a Christian Sudanese woman from being executed attracted more than a million supporters .
The woman , <START:person> Meriam Yehya Ibrahim <END> , was freed this summer with help from the Italian and American governments .
The pooling of so many investors in <START:organization> Change .org’s <END>
latest round recalls the angel investing model , in which investors typically put in much smaller amounts to finance fledgling companies , at a much large scale .
But it is unusual for a group of investors to commit so much money that funds from a traditional venture capital firm are unnecessary .
Last month , <START:organization> ZenPayroll <END> , a <START:location> San Francisco <END> start-up , was among the few companies to do something similar , with more than 50 individual investors participating in its latest $ 20 million fund-raising round .
<START:person> Mr. Rattray <END> said having this prominent group of investors support <START:organization> Change .org <END> would give him access to a network of advisers who could help guide the company as it continues to grow .
“These are people who recognize the power of the Internet , ” he said .
Others in the group include <START:person> Sam Altman <END> , the president of <START:organization> Y Combinator <END> , the tech incubator company , and <START:person> Michael Birch <END> , co-founder of <START:organization> Bebo <END> , a former social media site .
Because the money comes from individuals , not a venture capital firm with a specific time frame for getting a return on its investment , <START:organization> Change .org <END>
will not be under pressure to go public or sell quickly , <START:person> Mr. Rattray <END> said .
“The reason we want mission aligned investors with long-term horizons is so we can focus on the product , ” he said .
<START:person> Mr. Yang <END> , the <START:organization> Yahoo <END> co-founder , said he was not looking for a quick flip .
“Investing as an individual allows for a different time frame for an investment to mature , ” he wrote by email .
“For me , <START:organization> Change .org <END> is a long-term investment that is aligned with the company ’s mission and its vision for continued growth as an independent business . ”
One repeat investor in the round is <START:organization> Omidyar Network <END> , which represents <START:person> Mr. Omidyar <END> .
It had invested in <START:organization> Change .org <END> ,
and supported the unique fund-raising approach .
“We wanted to see the organization broaden out its sponsorship and sources of capital ” with “individuals who look like institutions and can write meaningful checks , ” said <START:person> Chris Bishko <END> , an investment partner at <START:organization> Omidyar Network <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Bishko <END> called <START:organization> Change .org <END> “a global platform that is giving ordinary people a stronger voice on how things operate . ”
“This is an incredible innovation , and we’re just at the tip of the iceberg , ” he said .
But petitions are not all that <START:organization> Change .org <END>
aspires to organize .
<START:person> Mr. Rattray <END> said he hoped it would also become a platform for organizing voting , fund-raising and more .
“Petitions are to <START:organization> Change .org <END> as books were to <START:organization> Amazon <END> , ” he said .

Rules , schmules .
As many people in <START:location> Portland , Ore. <END> , left work to return home on Friday evening , <START:organization> Uber <END> , the ride-hailing start-up , began offering rides in that city for the first time , despite loud protests from local officials who have deemed the service illegal .
That devil-may-care approach to dealing with city officials — entering a city without permission and dealing with regulatory issues after its services are well established and locals are already hooked — has become a hallmark of <START:organization> Uber’s <END> strategy .
In October , <START:organization> Uber <END> began its service in <START:location> Las Vegas <END> , where it was deemed illegal ; multiple drivers were cited within hours of the company ’s debut there .
Similar scenarios played out in <START:location> Austin , Tex . <END> , <START:location> Philadelphia <END> and other cities around the country .
But <START:organization> Uber’s <END> move in <START:location> Portland <END> comes just days after it vowed in a blog post to become a “ smarter and more humble company . ”
<START:organization> Uber <END> , which is now valued at more than $ 40 billion , is reeling from a string of recent embarrassments that have critics questioning its ethics .
The company ’s executives have been accused of taking a lax approach to customer privacy , among other criticisms .
In <START:location> Portland <END> , the commissioner in charge of the city ’s <START:organization> Bureau of Transportation <END> was furious enough at <START:organization> Uber <END> that he suggested <START:location> Portland <END> should amend its regulations to allow <START:organization> Lyft <END> — one of <START:organization> Uber’s <END> biggest competitors — instead of <START:organization> Uber <END> , to operate in the city .
On his <START:organization> Facebook <END> page , the mayor threatened fines for the company and its drivers .
“People should know that <START:organization> Uber’s <END> action is illegal , ” <START:person> Mayor Charlie Hales <END> said in the post .
“The city will enforce existing regulations .
That could include fines for the company , as well as fines for drivers . ”
<START:organization> Uber’s <END> service , which allows users to summon a private car with a smartphone app , has become hugely popular in the five years since it was started .
The service has ballooned and now operates in more than 250 cities in 50 countries .
<START:organization> Uber’s <END> arrival in <START:location> Portland <END> has been something of an inevitability .
The service has been available in more than a dozen cities surrounding the greater <START:location> Portland <END> area for months , and the company has been in talks with <START:location> Portland <END> .
“We’ve been talking to them for over a year , and we will continue to talk with them , ” said Eva Behrend , an <START:organization> Uber <END> spokeswoman .
But <START:location> Portland <END> transportation officials have fought to examine current regulatory statutes before allowing the service to operate in the city .
<START:person> Steve Novick <END> , the commissioner of the Bureau of Transportation , said he learned of <START:organization> Uber’s <END> intentions to set up shop earlier today when he received a text message from a reporter that said , <START:organization> “Uber <END> tells me they’re launching at 5 , do you have anything to say ? ”
Not long after , <START:person> Mr. Novick <END> and <START:person> Mr. Hales <END> were on a conference call with <START:organization> Uber’s <END> senior vice president for policy and strategy , <START:person> David Plouffe <END> , the former political strategist who ran <START:person> President Obama’s <END> 2008 campaign .
<START:person> “Plouffe <END> said , ‘ Well , you know we’re active in these markets and we’re providing a service and there is great demand in <START:location> Oregon <END> and blah blah blah , ’ ” <START:person> Mr. Novick <END> said .
“ I said , ‘Mr.
<START:person> Plouffe <END> , announcing that you’re going to break the law is not civil . ’
”
<START:person> Mr. Novick <END> added : “This is not about whether we should have a thoughtful conversation about changing taxi regulations — we’re up for that .
This is about one company thinking it is above the law . ”
If and when <START:location> Portland <END> amends its regulations to allow ride-sharing services like <START:organization> Uber <END> , <START:person> Mr. Novick <END> said he wished there were some way for him to still prohibit <START:organization> Uber <END> from coming to <START:location> Portland <END> .
“ I don’t know if this is legally feasible , but my inclination would be to allow <START:organization> Lyft <END> here a long time before <START:organization> Uber <END> , ” he said .
<START:organization> “Lyft <END> seems like a respectable company , and <START:organization> Uber <END> seems like a bunch of thugs . ”
But <START:organization> Uber <END> does not show signs of slowing down .
“The statement by <START:person> Commissioner Novick <END> shows a real disregard for consumer demand , choice and what the people of <START:location> Portland <END> want , ” <START:person> Ms. Behrend <END> , the <START:organization> Uber <END> spokeswoman , said .

The recidivism rate among companies caught violating securities laws can be a bit disheartening .
Despite settlements that include corporate proclamations of a commitment to compliance , the same names seem to appear again and again in settlements for new violations .
The <START:organization> Securities and Exchange Commission <END> has recently taken a small step toward making the cost of a violation a bit steeper by refusing to give companies a free pass .
In August , <START:organization> Bank of America <END> reached a $ 16.65 billion settlement with the <START:organization> Justice Department <END> over accusations that it duped investors into buying troubled residential mortgage-backed securities .
As part of that settlement , the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> resolved charges of securities fraud .
That case was fairly small , requiring the bank to pay about $ 135 million for selling a security that resulted in heavy losses to investors .
But getting the settlement approved was held up until late last month because the <START:organization> S.E.C.’s <END> commissioners could not agree on granting the bank a waiver from rules that could prevent it from selling certain investments .
That would have had a significant effect on its <START:organization> Merrill Lynch <END> subsidiary by cutting off access to certain types of hedge fund investments , a lucrative segment of the market that would probably cost it clients .
<START:organization> S.E.C. <END> Rule 506 permits sales of an unlimited amount of securities to “accredited investors , ” generally defined as those with the financial wherewithal to fend for themselves that do not need the protections provided by the disclosure requirements in the law .
This avenue is used annually to sell hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to large investors , like hedge funds and pension plans , and is a significant avenue for raising capital .
In the Dodd-Frank Act , <START:organization> Congress <END> directed the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> to write a “bad actor” rule .
That rule does n’t allow the exemption if the issuer of the securities or its underwriters was subject to a judicial or administrative order for engaging in fraud or similar types of violations , like failing to maintain adequate books and records .
Adopted in 2013 as an amendment to Rule 506 , it imposes a five-year ban on participating in securities offerings unless the firm can convince the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> that there is good cause “that it is not necessary under the circumstances . ”
There is another “bad actor” rule important to large companies like <START:organization> Bank of America <END> that routinely access the securities markets to raise capital .
Under Rule 405 , a “well-known seasoned issuer ” does not have to submit its offering documents in advance for review by the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> before selling securities , allowing it to act quickly when market conditions are favorable .
Like Rule 506 , this provision cannot be used by a company subject to an order prohibiting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws as part of a settlement .
But it can be waived for “good cause . ”
Those waivers had become routine after a settlement with the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END>
Some companies , in fact , received multiple waivers .
But last April , <START:person> Kara M. Stein <END> , one of the five commissioners , dissented from the order granting a waiver to the <START:organization> Royal Bank of Scotland <END> after one of its subsidiaries pleaded guilty to manipulating the <START:location> London <END> interbank offered rate , or Libor .
In a statement , <START:person> Ms. Stein <END> warned that by routinely granting such waivers , the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> “may have enshrined a new policy — that some firms are just too big to bar . ”
That warning came to haunt <START:organization> Bank of America <END> when it sought a waiver from the bad actor exclusion under Rule 506 after its mortgage-backed security settlement .
The bank was a victim of circumstances because <START:person> Mary Jo White <END> , the chairwoman of the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> , had to recuse herself from the case because of her prior representation of <START:person> Kenneth D. Lewis <END> , the bank’s former chief executive .
<START:organization> Bloomberg <END> reported that the four remaining commissioners were split 2 to 2 on whether to grant a waiver , with <START:person> Ms. Stein’s <END> fellow Democratic commissioner , <START:person> Luis A. Aguilar <END> , joining her in holding up approval of the settlement until the waiver issue could be resolved .
The settlement was finally approved right before Thanksgiving when <START:organization> Bank of America <END> agreed to appoint an outside monitor “not unacceptable ” to the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> to conduct a comprehensive review of its compliance with Rule 506 in exchange for a waiver of the bad actor ban .
Importantly , the waiver is only good for 30 months , so <START:organization> Bank of America <END> will have to come back to the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> to show there is good cause for a waiver of the rest of the five-year prohibition .
The order also does not grant a waiver from the ban in Rule 405 on bad actors using the well-known seasoned issuer exemption .
Although it is likely that <START:organization> Bank of America <END> will seek such a waiver in the future , for the moment , it will be a bit more difficult for the bank to quickly access the securities markets .
With settlements looming for big banks over their role in manipulation of foreign exchange rates , the question is whether the treatment of <START:organization> Bank of America <END> will become the norm for obtaining waivers from the bad actor rules or whether the <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> will revert to its earlier pattern of routinely granting those requests .
The circumstances requiring <START:organization> Bank of America <END> to work hard for a waiver were unusual because <START:person> Ms. White’s <END> withdrawal from the case led to the even split between the remaining commissioners .
So it could be a one-time situation .
One issue that has divided the commission is whether to view the bad actor rules as another form of punishment for a violation , or as a remedy limited to violations that directly involve a company ’s financial reporting .
A Republican commissioner , <START:person> Daniel M. Gallagher <END> , issued a statement in April arguing that “the punishment-focused view ” of waivers of the well-known seasoned issuer rule “is even more troubling ” because the harm is inflicted on shareholders from the increased costs of issuing securities .
“We must have a robust waiver program to appropriately distinguish between cases when disqualification is and is not justified , ” he said .
In a speech on Dec. 4 , <START:person> Ms. Stein <END> celebrated the aggressive approach taken with <START:organization> Bank of America <END> , stating that “we should be flexible and nuanced in our approach to these waivers , so that we make the most of this powerful tool . ”
She described the <START:organization> Bank of America <END> order as “a breakthrough in the commission’s method of handling waivers , and I hope to see more of this and other thoughtful approaches in the future . ”
The terms of <START:organization> Bank of America’s <END> waiver that require appointment of a monitor are not particularly onerous .
But they are a change from the days when granting such requests was almost a matter of routine .
No agency wants to be known as going soft on the companies it regulates , and the bad actor rules had become like sending a child to the time-out chair at home — a mild threat that was easily discarded once the appropriate apology was made .
The <START:organization> S.E.C. <END> is likely to take a tougher stance in agreeing to waivers of the bad actor prohibition , which means defense lawyers will have to consider the waiver issue right from the start rather than assuming the agency will rubber-stamp requests .

A new project called <START:organization> CrowdSolve <END> debuting on <START:organization> Indiegogo <END> today asks the question : What happens if you use the “wisdom of the crowd ” to solve crime ?
It’s a marked contrast from the heroic image of the solitary detective , a la <START:person> Batman <END> or <START:organization> Sherlock Holmes <END> , but one that might resonate more with our recent collective fascination with <START:organization> Serial <END> , the ongoing podcast spun out of <START:organization> This American Life <END> documenting the murder of a <START:location> Baltimore <END> woman and the conviction of her accused killer .
<START:organization> Serial’s <END> story arc includes a murder , the subsequent investigation and a conviction , but it has still resulted in a veritable legion of amateur detectives who collectively pore over and obsess about the details of the case , gathering on <START:organization> Reddit <END> and other platforms and working together to potentially uncover new evidence and propose alternate theories of what really happened .
<START:organization> CrowdSolve’s <END> founder <START:person> Colin Helibut <END> wonders whether the same intense focus could be leveraged to help the roughly 50,000 to 120,000 wrongfully convicted people in prison in the U.S. right now (using study estimates of 2.5 percent to 5 percent in jail currently wrongfully convicted , with U.S. prison population of 2.4 million ) .
<START:organization> CrowdSolve’s <END> goal with <START:organization> Indiegogo <END> is to raise $ 50,000 to help pay the government and administrative fees associated with accessing public case files and other documents , and to build visualization tools that will allow the community to better make sense of their data .
The community will include moderation , and an up/downvoting system similar to <START:organization> Reddit <END> to help make sure things stay on track and the best information rises to the top , and participants will build cases and theories that they can then hand off to others , or work on collaboratively and have vetted by the community .
Of course , everything about this idea should be setting off alarm bells in your head right now – the crowd’s “wisdom” is not always best defined as such , after all .
<START:organization> Reddit <END> has demonstrated the weakness of the concept of crowd-sourced investigation by mis-identifying suspects in the past , including the <START:organization> Boston Marathon <END> bomber .
<START:person> Helibut <END> tells <START:organization> TechCrunch <END> that the idea behind <START:organization> CrowdSolve <END> is actually to counter some of <START:organization> Reddit’s <END> inherent weakness when it comes to crowdsourced crime fighting .
<START:organization> “Reddit <END> is a wonderful and hugely important community , but at its core , it ’s purpose is general conversation and news aggregation , ” he said .
“Their basic setup and infrastructure is not well-suited to data-organization , citation , annotation , etc .
On the other hand , <START:organization> CrowdSolve <END> is being built from the ground-up to foster the exploration and exposition of criminal investigations in a transparent , tightly monitored way . ”
<START:person> Helibut <END> also answers concerns about the weakness of the model by pointing to the sacrifices made in doing nothing : <START:organization> The Innocence Project <END> and others devoted to reversing wrongful convictions have limited resources , he points out , and there are precious few alternatives that can scale to properly address the problem .
It’s true that if <START:organization> CrowdSolve <END> can actually help reverse wrongful convictions , it will have a social impact that ’s hard to overvalue , but there’s a very good reason investigators often refrain from sharing case details with the public early on – groups can make mistakes just as easily as individuals , and the ramifications of making erroneous assumptions in the public sphere is often far more devastating than making them behind closed doors .
Even with so-called “cold cases , ” amateur investigations have the potential to upend lives , including those of innocent people close to the case .
Data , analytical tools and moderation might be the key to regulating a process that could easily spiral dangerously out of control , but there’s little evidence yet to suggest using the distributed processing approach to solving crime will have the same impact to social good that crowdsourced gene sequencing has had to science : the former involves a lot more reliance on the fragile and changeable beast that is human judgement , and that ’s a powder keg ready just waiting for a match .

<START:organization> Amazon <END> just made good on its promise .
<START:organization> HBO GO <END> is now available on the <START:organization> Amazon Fire TV <END> and will hit the Fire TV Stick this coming spring .
Best yet , the app fully supports <START:organization> Amazon’s <END> impressive voice search that let’s users find content with a button built into the Fire TV remote .
When the <START:organization> Fire TV <END> launched , <START:organization> Amazon <END> CEO <START:person> Jeff Bezos <END> promised that the streamer would get <START:organization> HBO GO <END> by the end of the year .
And with just two weeks go in 2014 , <START:organization> Amazon <END> just made the cut .
“Since launch we’ve increased the number of services available on <START:organization> Amazon Fire TV <END> by more than 4x , ” said <START:person> Peter Larsen <END> , Vice President <START:organization> Amazon Devices <END> , said in a released statement .
“We’re thrilled to add <START:organization> HBO GO <END> , the most requested service , to <START:organization> Fire TV <END> in time for the holidays .
<START:organization> HBO <END> has produced some of the most groundbreaking and award-winning TV shows and movies , and we are excited to bring this amazing content to our customers , all of which is accessible via voice search on your <START:organization> Fire TV <END> remote . ”
<START:organization> Amazon <END> had previously cut a deal with HBO that brought a large chunk of <START:organization> HBO’s <END> back catalog to <START:organization> Amazon Prime Instant Video <END> and the Fire TV devices .
Yet new content from new series like <START:organization> Game of Thrones <END> , <START:organization> The Newsroom <END> and <START:organization> Girls <END> were missing .
The addition of this app sort of solves that problem ; an <START:organization> HBO <END> subscription is still required to view the content .

<START:organization> Hiptic Games <END> , a <START:organization> Y Combinator <END> alum that ’s been operating in stealth since the summer 2011 batch , has launched <START:organization> GameThrive <END> , a push notification service that aims to help developers engage players when they’re least likely to be annoyed .
Originally built for the team’s own needs , the service combines push-notification delivery automation with analytics tools to avoid overwhelming users to the point where they delete an app .
Looking at things like playing habits and response rates to different notifications , the service schedules messages for in-game deals or events at times when players will be mostly likely to engage with them and come back to the game .
<START:organization> GameThrive <END> is available as a native SDK for <START:organization> iOS <END> , <START:organization> Android <END> , and <START:organization> Windows Phone <END> , but most developers will probably find it easier to build into games using SDKs for popular engines .
With the exception of Unreal , there are kits available for most major mobile engines including <START:organization> Unity <END> and <START:organization> Cocos2d-x <END> .
<START:organization> Corona <END> and <START:organization> Marmalade <END> have actually partnered with <START:organization> Hiptic <END> to make it available directly to developers who download their engines without requiring a separate add-on .
<START:organization> Hiptic <END> CEO <START:person> George Deglin <END> says that most of the 900 developers using the service have been grandfathered in on special beta pricing plans and don’t have to pay until they’re delivering notifications to 8 million devices .
Those signing up now won’t pay if they’re reaching fewer than 1 million devices , with plans starting at $ 49 per month for user bases bigger than that .
As mentioned in the blog post announcing the service’s launch , <START:organization> Hiptic <END> hopes to bring over developers who rely on <START:organization> Urban Airship’s <END> free notification tier , which ends at the end of this month .
They’ve built a tool that automates migrating over from that service using just your credentials .

<START:organization> Homejoy <END> , the <START:location> U.S. <END> domestic cleaning startup that ’s backed by the likes of <START:organization> Google Ventures <END> to the tune of $ 38 million , is putting another of its international operations on hold .
Following news earlier today that its Canada-based business is being “paused” , <START:organization> TechCrunch <END> has learned that <START:organization> Homejoy’s <END> activities in <START:location> France <END> have been met with the same fate .
A spokesperson told me that what this means in practice is that the company is no longer accepting bookings in France , while — in a line similar to the one given regarding <START:location> Canada <END> — it ’s maintaining relationships with the cleaners locally who were signed up to its platform , for when ( or if ? ) <START:organization> Homejoy <END> re-enters <START:location> France <END> .
Relationships , of course , can’t be put on hold forever , and it would seem inevitable that those cleaners will now be looking for work elsewhere .
Meanwhile , the company is keen to stress that it remains active in <START:location> Europe <END> — specifically , that it is choosing to focus on <START:location> Germany <END> , where <START:location> Berlin <END> will now act as its European customer service “hub” , and the <START:location> UK <END> where it currently has operations in <START:location> London <END> .
It’s also recently added <START:location> Munich <END> to its German presence , which also includes <START:location> Hamburg <END> .
What’s interesting about <START:organization> Homejoy’s <END> “pausing ” of operations in <START:location> Canada <END> and <START:location> France <END> is that it recently saw a new and potentially formidable competitor in the form of <START:organization> Rocket Internet’s <END> <START:organization> Helpling <END> , which has recently launched its domestic cleaning service in both countries .
<START:location> Paris <END> in particular looks to be heating up as a battleground .
Alongside <START:organization> Helpling <END> , there’s UK-headquartered and Accel-backed <START:organization> Hassle <END> , which actually expanded to the French capital city before the <START:organization> Rocket Internet <END> startup made its way across the border .
Both companies will probably be glad to see the back of <START:organization> Homejoy <END> , at least for now .
You know what they say , if you can’t stand the heat …

Hang with startup kids long enough , and you’ll notice that they have their own language .
No, bro , it ’s a SaaS play in the on-demand food space .
Think of it as the <START:organization> Uber <END> for gluten-free <START:organization> Whole Foods <END> delivery , ok ?
It never ends : We’re actively raising , but really want to make sure that we hit investor-board fit before product-market sync , you know ?
This can be confusing .
However , <START:organization> TechCrunch <END> is here to demystify startup lingo into a more common lingua franca .
The startup kids , after all , are worth trying to understand .
One or two of them might even build something usable .
So , without further ado , I give you How To Speak Startup :
Acqui-hire – A strategy for acquiring talent pioneered by <START:organization> Google <END> in the mid-2000s that happens when a bigger company thinks your team is good but your idea is hilariously bad .
Also called a “signing bonus . ”
Failure – A bad thing that the Silly Valley has recently put on a pedestal as something to be celebrated .
Cashflow Positive – Someone gave us a dollar .
Pivot – What happens when a company realizes their course of action is not living up to expectations .
The classic historic example is <START:organization> The Point <END> , which became <START:organization> Groupon <END> after the company posted a coupon to a pizza place in <START:organization> The Point’s <END> building in <START:location> Chicago <END> .
( See also , Failure . )
SaaS — It loses money .
Pre-Money Valuation – A number you made up .
Post-Money Valuation – A number that you made up alongside your VC with the addition of some cash .
Your burn rate is probably too high .
“ I work in PR.” – I am , in fact , in possession of several journalists ’ email addresses .
Exit – Exits come in two different flavors for entrepreneurs : good and bad .
Good exits happen when you’re “killing it” , your company has n’t killed you yet , and another company comes along to buy yours .
( See possibly , acqui-hire . )
Bad exits are another way of saying you failed to disrupt much of anything besides your VC’s portfolio performance .
“I’m a serial entrepreneur . ”
– Person who had two ideas , both of which failed .
The Space – Because calling the field in which they’re operating an industry , vertical or even genre is too hard , entrepreneurs like referring to their company as being a player in a given space .
They especially like doing this when they know they’re in a crowded market .
We don’t know why they do this either .
VC – 1 ) Venture capitalists raise money from wealthy individuals and institutions and dump lots of said money into young companies in exchange for a cut of the company .
2 ) An institutional dealer of pharmaceutical-grade Opium .
( See also , Opium . )
Opium – OPM , or “other people’s money” , is an incredibly addictive substance to entrepreneurs that ’s rarely respected or missed until it dries up .
“We’re doing great . ”
– We are not doing great .
SF / The Valley – A place that VC’s and tech luminaries talk up as the greatest place on Earth that you must move to if you’re from anywhere that is n’t <START:location> SF <END> or <START:location> The Valley <END> .
“We’re growing 500 percent week-over-week ” — Last week we had one user , today we have six .
“We’re not currently raising . ”
— We’re currently raising .
UI/UX – A portmanteau of UI ( “User Interface” ) and UX ( “User Experience” ) often used by design-challenged entrepreneurs when referring to the aesthetics and usability of their product when actual understanding of good design principles is fundamentally lacking .
Used in a sentence : “Our Push for Pizza for Nickelodeon VHS tapes app is crushing it because of our design wizard is slinging some hella dope UI/UX.”
“We’re a design-centric organization . ”
– We don’t know how to code .
Non-GAAP Profitable — What companies that are very unprofitable like to claim .
The idea that non-cash costs don’t count is usually the sort of sickness you see here .
“I’m the business guy . ”
– ( See : Free-rider problem , Growth Hacker . )
Gravity — We don’t have that in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> .
$ 32 Million Series A Round – Something that is doomed to failure .
Growth Hacking – Sales , marketing and associated activities , but with a label that incorporates the word “hacking , ” because nontechnical people want to call themselves “hackers ” too .
“We’re seeing great gross margins , and so are investing in growth given our strong , SaaS unit-economics . ”
— We lose money .
“We’re stomping on the gas pedal , given our strong SaaS unit-economics , and are actively seeking additional capital to power our sector-leading growth . ”
— We have lost all our money and need some of yours , please .
“We’re Crushing It ! ” – Your dreams and investors ’ dollars are probably being crushed .
First rule of <START:organization> Fight Club <END> , bro .
We hope this helps .

<START:person> Mark Zuckerberg’s <END> <START:organization> Facebook <END> profile has come under attack from a large number of online trolls who are taking advantage of the opportunity to leave comments , including stickers , photos and other “meme” images , on the <START:organization> Facebook <END> CEO’s public posts .
The attackers are largely based in <START:location> Brazil <END> , and their barrage of comments and jokes have continued for several days now , nonstop .
We’ve heard some reports , via tipsters , that the attack started as some kind of protest against the low reach of <START:organization> Facebook Pages <END> , but that remains unclear .
The messages and comments currently visible don’t speak to any specific agenda or complaint against <START:organization> Facebook <END> or its founder , but rather seem to be random , and sometimes bizarre , posts typical to spam attacks instigated by trolls .
The trolling is taking place on older posts which are further back on Mark <START:person> Zuckerberg’s <END> Timeline .
It appears the attacks began in the comments section of a post in May 2012 where <START:person> Zuckerberg <END> added a “life event ” announcing his marriage to <START:person> Priscilla Chan <END> .
There are now nearly 2 million Likes on that image and 186,400+ comments , most of which are now nonsensical photos and memes , stickers and other random comments .
Few commenters are leaving any text comments of their own .
Another post – this one where <START:person> Zuckerberg <END> announced he became a vegetarian in January 2011 – is also seeing massive abuse , with now over 108,000 comments .
Some of the commenters have even begun leaving images that say things like ( roughly translated ) , “this trolling is out of control . ”
Many also just say “come join the ‘zueira , '” which basically means trolling or disorder .
“Trolling today , trolling tomorrow , trolling forever ” reads one .
“Go go go zoeira” proclaims another .
While it ’s unknown at this time who started the trolling or why , one link in a news article pointed to this <START:organization> Facebook <END> group titled “Flood that <START:person> Mark <END> ” ( translation via <START:organization> Google Translate <END> ) .
The group currently has 1,153 members and instructs them , in Portuguese , to participate in challenges and reminds them “what happens in the group , stays in the group . ”
The group ’s banner image include photos of <START:person> Zuckerberg <END> , his wife and an image that is regularly seen in the trolls ’ <START:organization> Facebook <END> comments .
One commenter on a Brazilian news site said the group would not stop until it reached a record number of comments .
We’ve asked <START:organization> Facebook <END> if it was aware of the abuse , and what , if any , actions it ’s planning to take to stem the flood of comments .
We’ll update if <START:organization> Facebook <END> responds .

Your house is cold , but your thermostat is way over there .
You could walk over to your thermostat and crank the heat , but pfft , walking .
If you have a <START:organization> Nest <END> , you could open up the app and control it that way , but , pfft , opening apps by hand .
What is this , 2007 ? !
As of this morning , you can now control a <START:organization> Nest <END> with your voice .
Making use of that $ 3.2 billion acquisition it made earlier this year , <START:organization> Google <END> is integrating <START:organization> Nest <END> functionality into <START:organization> Google Now <END> .
Want to make it warmer ?
Just say “Ok <START:organization> Google <END> , change temperature to 75 degrees . ”
to your phone .
Meanwhile , <START:organization> Google Now <END> will also throw up a card whenever <START:organization> Nest’s <END> automated control settings kick in .
If it decides to bump the temperature up on its own to prep for your arrival from work , for example , it’ll show up as a Now card .
A few things to note :
Okay , <START:organization> Google <END> .
Now teach my house to respond to “Tea , Earl Grey , Hot . ”

Are you ready to amp up your acoustic guitar to the MAXXXX ?
The <START:organization> ToneWoodAmp <END> has got you covered .
This surprisingly cool <START:organization> Kickstarter <END> project is essentially a speaker that takes the sound coming in from your acoustic guitar , modifies it , and then reproduces it automatically so you can hear it out of the guitar body .
It’s great for folks who might not have access to effects pedals or a PA system and for buskers or live players who are looking for an interesting way to modify a standard guitar .
The amp connects to the back of your guitar and the sound reverberates through the body .
It has a number of inbuilt effects including tremolo an reverb and you can even run the sound through an iOS device to use software filters and effects .
The amp costs $ 110 for early bird backers and will eventually retail for $ 199 .
The team has working prototypes so far and it looks like it ’s going to ship in June .
While most guitarists already have a bank of pedals and effects they use , having this attached to an acoustic guitar seems like an interesting solution for gear heads .
The kit connects to your guitar using magnetic rails that are mounted inside the guitar .
This means it can be removed as necessary and won’t destroy the outside of your guitar .
As <START:organization> TechCrunch’s <END> resident SHRED MAETERXXXTOTHEMAXXX I’m actually curious how this sounds and how it works outdoors .
Who knows , the next busker you meet may be able to truly SHRED a little Stairway next to the <START:organization> Cold Stone <END> using electronic effects and an old <START:organization> Fender <END> .

The hostage situation in <START:location> Sydney’s <END> busy city district has crossed over into day two , with the identity of the hostage taker revealed as <START:person> Man Haron Monis <END> .
The perpetrator , 49 , is a self-proclaimed sheikh already pending trial and out on bail for being an accessory to murder .
He still has an unconfirmed number of hostages captured inside a <START:organization> Lindt Cafe <END> in <START:location> Sydney <END> .
Some hostages escaped or were otherwise freed , and police have now stormed the cafe , according to the <START:organization> NYT <END> .
<START:organization> TechCrunch <END> is n’t the place for breaking news on the situation , which can be found here and here .
But as the world watches <START:location> Sydney <END> , we noticed a specific , and now-viral , status update from <START:person> Jason Maggs <END> .
It has now been shared more than 16,000 times on <START:organization> Facebook <END> , noted by <START:organization> FBNewswire <END> , and we’re simply hoping to pass the powerful message along .
He wrote :
<START:person> Jason’s <END> status update is just a small part of Australia’s social media reaction .
The hashtag # IWillRideWithYou is growing in <START:location> Australia <END> , with more than 100k shares across <START:organization> Facebook <END> and <START:organization> Twitter <END> .
The hashtag is meant to express solidarity among Australians as they use public transport , encouraging those religiously dressed to feel safe and those who are not , to feel safe around them .
It was reportedly started by a girl named <START:person> Rachael <END> , who recounted an experience on a public train the morning that the hostage crisis began .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the hostages , their families , and anyone victimized or involved in the situation .
And also , we agree with <START:person> Jason <END> .

“No one’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny , ” reads an <START:organization> NYT <END> op-ed penned by screenwriter and playwright <START:person> Aaron Sorkin <END> , angrily blasting the media for reporting the private details revealed through the recent hack of <START:organization> Sony Pictures Entertainment <END> , in what’s shaping up to be one of the largest corporate data breaches to date .
“…Every news outlet that did the bidding of the [hacking group ] <START:organization> Guardians of Peace <END> is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable , ” he adds .
Meanwhile , <START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> – blithely ignoring the First Amendment ( and the <START:person> Streisand <END> effect ) – has threatened legal action against journalists reporting on the findings from the stolen documents .
<START:person> Sorkin <END> and <START:organization> Sony <END> are both wrong .
<START:organization> Sony <END> may be a victim , but there is data in the breach that ’s worth reporting to the public – even if one of the largest takeaways is for other corporations to react to <START:organization> Sony <END> ’s cautionary tale and beef up its own servers and security infrastructure .
<START:organization> Sony <END> Tries Silencing Reporters
One thing the world needs to understand immediately is that all information is public by default , and the only real privacy protection is that its exposure has yet to be targeted by determined hackers .
Over the past several years , hackers have stolen consumers ’ personal information and credit card numbers from some of the largest retailers .
They’ve pulled nude photos off celebrity’s phones and from “private” messaging app <START:organization> Snapchat <END> .
Large companies like <START:organization> Adobe <END> and <START:organization> eBay <END> have seen emails and other personal account information stolen .
And whistleblowers like <START:person> Snowden <END> have revealed the most private and devastating aspects of government spying agendas .
There is literally nothing that is above being exposed publicly if the right people are focused on a specific agenda .
The <START:organization> Sony <END> hack was carried out by a group referring to itself as the <START:organization> “Guardians of Peace <END> . ”
The group has demanded that <START:organization> Sony <END> pull its upcoming movie <START:organization> “The Interview <END> , ” starring <START:person> Seth Rogen <END> and <START:person> James Franco <END> , which was based on a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader <START:person> Kim Jong Un <END> .
The group has leaked a number of <START:organization> Sony <END> movies online including the yet-to-be released remake of <START:organization> “Annie <END> , ” plus “Mr.
Turner , ” <START:organization> “Still Alice <END> , ” and <START:organization> “To Write Love on Her Arms <END> , ” alongside large data dumps from inside <START:organization> Sony <END> ’s corporate network .
The reaction , however , of hacking victims like <START:organization> Sony <END> should not include tantrums like those now demonstrated by <START:person> Sorkin <END> and the studio itself .
They should only offer apologies , if they say anything at all .
Apologies for making the hack just so damned easy , keeping some of the company ’s most private information on its operations , its employees ( and their families ) in unencrypted Excel and Word files and carelessly shared emails .
That’s not to blame the victims themselves , though – individuals make mistakes , but corporate IT policies are meant to protect those mistakes from becoming publicly shared data .
<START:organization> Sony Pictures <END> , one of the <START:location> U.S. <END> ’s largest studios , has now , somewhat ridiculously , asked journalists to destroy the stolen documents , and warned that those who did n’t comply will face further action , the company threatened via letters sent to a number of online and print publishers .
<START:organization> “Sony Pictures Entertainment <END> will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you , ” the letter states .
News media has reported on a number of these leaked emails , which have included private jabs , jokes and commentary , including a director referring to <START:location> Hollywood <END> star <START:person> Angelina Jolie <END> as a “spoiled brat , ” <START:organization> Sony <END> ’s botching of the <START:person> Steve Jobs <END> movie , and racist riffs between studio co-chairman <START:person> Amy Pascal <END> and producer <START:person> Scott Rudin <END> about what <START:person> President Obama’s <END> favorite movies might be .
One could argue that those sorts of details , as <START:person> Sorkin <END> claims , were exploited for pageviews more so than public good .
But that ’s not looking at the bigger picture related to the media’s coverage of the hack .
Beyond providing fodder for gossip blogs , the <START:organization> Sony <END> hack has also revealed serious information that ’s arguably more serving of the “public interest . ”
( Hint : that ’s what journalists are supposed to cover – a topic , incidentally , that <START:person> Sorkin’s <END> own show <START:organization> HBO’s <END> <START:organization> “The Newsroom” <END> has grappled with recently , when its reporters for a fictional news network resembling <START:organization> CNN <END> landed a treasure trove of stolen <START:organization> Department of Defense <END> documents . )
Worth Revealing ?
The <START:organization> Sony <END> hack has displayed a lot about the failing of our modern , wired corporate culture .
Like just how casual internal company HR employees treat email communication , for example .
Email is not private ; as a former IT worker , I could have accessed any inbox on my domain ( and often did , though not for reading emails , but for legitimate reasons like backup , archiving , or transfer to a new hire ) .
But more importantly , employees dealing with sensitive information seem not to understand that email is not a place where an HR employee needs to be detailing a child’s medical treatment , where that treatment is taking place , the child’s name , how the child was doing in treatment , and more .
<START:organization> Sony <END> , and likely other organizations that are currently fortunate enough to not have their poor security policies exposed , also does not seem to understand that if you’re choosing to record Social Security numbers , birth dates and salaries in Excel spreadsheets , you should protect them with at least a minimum amount of security , by way of encryption .
Or hell , even a password .
( That’s not to say the files could n’t have still been hacked , but it would have made it that much harder . )
In addition , while the hackers may have accessed the files in question illegally , there are insights the files reveal that are worth sharing more broadly .
It’s worth informing the public that the studio’s upper management is 94 percent male , and 88 percent white ( as Fusion reports ) – making them less diverse than the much-lambasted tech companies whose recent barrage of diversity reports have revealed their tendencies toward monoculture , for instance .
Image credit , above : <START:organization> Fusion .net <END>
Another key item that was revealed by journalists reporting on the <START:organization> Sony <END> leak was that of Hollywood’s war against Google , which was code-named “Project Goliath ” in email threads .
As detailed by <START:organization> The Verge <END> , lawyers from the <START:organization> MPAA <END> and half a dozen major studios refer to “Goliath ” as their biggest enemy in their battle with online piracy , and the <START:organization> Sony <END> emails discuss a variety of tactics to fight “Goliath , ” including site blocking , legal action involving state attorneys general , political lobbying , and more .
<START:organization> Sony <END> ’s Emails Could Be Your Emails
<START:person> Sorkin <END> ( and <START:organization> Sony <END> ) are fine to criticize reporters ’ editorial choices .
But <START:person> Sorkin <END> , in a nutshell , is wrong to say that reporting on the leaks is “spectacularly dishonorable ” as a whole .
And neither is he correct in thinking that the right to report should be shut down .
These leaks have contained thousands of Social Security numbers , personnel files containing employee salaries and severance costs , personal information on employees and execs including birth dates , and even health records for dozens of employees , their spouses and their children .
The press is not generally pointing to the actual files in question , hosting them on their own sites in full , or revealing details like which employees had high medical bills , or which child’s medical claims were being denied .
The media has reported , however , that is the kind of information these documents contain .
And it ’s worth doing so : <START:organization> Sony <END> ’s emails could be your emails .
They could be your company ’s emails .
Those could be your kids .
If an organization of <START:organization> Sony <END> ’s size is susceptible to hacking , anyone is .
In the aftermath , <START:organization> Sony <END> has now hired <START:organization> FireEye Inc. <END> ’s <START:organization> Mandiant <END> forensics unit to clean up this massive cyber attack , as the <START:organization> FBI <END> investigates the incident .
But the immediate damage has been done and the damage may continue for some time .
Only a small number of documents have been revealed so far – the hackers reportedly captured over 100 terabytes of data .
Headlines about <START:location> Hollywood <END> actors or ego-damaging asides may draw pageviews ( and may be in poor taste ) , but what’s not up for debate is whether journalists can report on illegally obtained files – they can , thanks to First Amendment protections .
Is there anything in the files that “can help , inform or protect anyone ? , ” asks <START:person> Sorkin <END> , mid-tirade .
Yes , as our above examples show .
But also , more generally , that this happened , that this level of private data can be revealed , and that it can be revealed with ease can help us all .
Let it serve as a warning to everyone from corporate IT to everyday consumers to protect ourselves…or risk becoming the next <START:organization> Sony <END> .
