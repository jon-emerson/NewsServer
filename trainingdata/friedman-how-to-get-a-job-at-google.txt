<START:location> MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif <END> .
— LAST June , in an interview with Adam Bryant of The Times , <START:person> Laszlo Bock <END> , the senior vice president of people operations for <START:organization> Google <END> — i .e . , the guy in charge of hiring for one of the world’s most successful companies — noted that <START:organization> Google <END> had determined that “G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring , and test scores are worthless .
... We found that they don’t predict anything . ”
He also noted that the “proportion of people without any college education at <START:organization> Google <END> has increased over time ” — now as high as 14 percent on some teams .
At a time when many people are asking , “How’s my kid gonna get a job ? ”
I thought it would be useful to visit <START:organization> Google <END> and hear how <START:person> Bock <END> would answer .
Don’t get him wrong , <START:person> Bock <END> begins , “Good grades certainly don’t hurt . ”
Many jobs at <START:organization> Google <END> require math , computing and coding skills , so if your good grades truly reflect skills in those areas that you can apply , it would be an advantage .
But <START:organization> Google <END> has its eyes on much more .
“There are five hiring attributes we have across the company , ” explained <START:person> Bock <END> .
“If it ’s a technical role , we assess your coding ability , and half the roles in the company are technical roles .
For every job , though , the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability , and it ’s not I.Q .
It’s learning ability .
It’s the ability to process on the fly .
It’s the ability to pull together disparate bits of information .
We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they’re predictive . ”
The second , he added , “is leadership — in particular emergent leadership as opposed to traditional leadership .
Traditional leadership is , were you president of the chess club ?
Were you vice president of sales ?
How quickly did you get there ?
We don’t care .
What we care about is , when faced with a problem and you’re a member of a team , do you , at the appropriate time , step in and lead .
And just as critically , do you step back and stop leading , do you let someone else ?
Because what’s critical to be an effective leader in this environment is you have to be willing to relinquish power . ”
What else ? Humility and ownership .
“It’s feeling the sense of responsibility , the sense of ownership , to step in , ” he said , to try to solve any problem — and the humility to step back and embrace the better ideas of others .
“Your end goal , ” explained <START:person> Bock <END> , “is what can we do together to problem-solve .
I’ve contributed my piece , and then I step back . ”
And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute , says <START:person> Bock <END> , it ’s “intellectual humility .
Without humility , you are unable to learn . ”
It is why research shows that many graduates from hotshot business schools plateau .
“Successful bright people rarely experience failure , and so they don’t learn how to learn from that failure , ” said <START:person> Bock <END> .
“They , instead , commit the fundamental attribution error , which is if something good happens , it ’s because I’m a genius .
If something bad happens , it ’s because someone’s an idiot or I did n’t get the resources or the market moved .
... What we’ve seen is that the people who are the most successful here , who we want to hire , will have a fierce position .
They’ll argue like hell .
They’ll be zealots about their point of view .
But then you say , ‘here’s a new fact , ’ and they’ll go , ‘ Oh , well , that changes things ; you’re right . ’
” You need a big ego and small ego in the same person at the same time .
The least important attribute they look for is “expertise . ”
Said <START:person> Bock <END> : “If you take somebody who has high cognitive ability , is innately curious , willing to learn and has emergent leadership skills , and you hire them as an H.R. person or finance person , and they have no content knowledge , and you compare them with someone who’s been doing just one thing and is a world expert , the expert will go : ‘I’ve seen this 100 times before ; here ’s what you do . ’ ” Most of the time the nonexpert will come up with the same answer , added <START:person> Bock <END> , “because most of the time it ’s not that hard . ”
Sure , once in a while they will mess it up , he said , but once in a while they’ll also come up with an answer that is totally new .
And there is huge value in that .
To sum up <START:person> Bock <END>’s approach to hiring : Talent can come in so many different forms and be built in so many nontraditional ways today , hiring officers have to be alive to every one — besides brand-name colleges .
Because “when you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world , those are exceptional human beings .
And we should do everything we can to find those people . ”
Too many colleges , he added , “don’t deliver on what they promise .
You generate a ton of debt , you don’t learn the most useful things for your life .
It’s [just ] an extended adolescence . ”
<START:organization> Google <END> attracts so much talent it can afford to look beyond traditional metrics , like G.P.A.
For most young people , though , going to college and doing well is still the best way to master the tools needed for many careers .
But <START:person> Bock <END> is saying something important to them , too : Beware .
Your degree is not a proxy for your ability to do any job .
The world only cares about — and pays off on — what you can do with what you know ( and it does n’t care how you learned it ) .
And in an age when innovation is increasingly a group endeavor , it also cares about a lot of soft skills — leadership , humility , collaboration , adaptability and loving to learn and re-learn .
This will be true no matter where you go to work .
