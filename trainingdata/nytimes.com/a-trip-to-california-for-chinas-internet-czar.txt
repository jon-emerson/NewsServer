<START:location> HONG KONG <END> — At least one thing caught the eye of <START:location> China’s <END> Internet czar during his trip to the <START:location> United States <END> last week : a book written by and about the president of <START:location> China <END> on the desk of <START:person> Mark Zuckerberg <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg <END> , the chief executive of <START:organization> Facebook <END> , pointed to the book , “ <START:person> Xi Jinping <END> : The Governance of <START:organization> China <END> ” last week while giving a tour of the company ’s office to <START:person> Lu Wei <END> , the de facto head of Internet policy in <START:location> China <END> .
<START:person> Mr. Lu <END> laughed when he saw the book , an anthology of speeches and comments by <START:person> President Xi <END> .
He then asked to sit down at <START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg’s <END> desk to have a closer look , according to an account published on a Chinese state-run website .
The interaction was confirmed by a person close to the traveling group who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private .
<START:organization> Facebook <END> is typically blocked in <START:location> China <END>  .
<START:person> Mr. Lu <END> , as <START:location> China’s <END> new Internet czar , holds the key for American Internet companies to the enormous Chinese market .
He is also the ambassador of an assertive new policy in which <START:location> China <END> claims the right to block websites , censor content and track users within its borders .
One photo taken of the <START:organization> Facebook <END> visit and posted on a site associated with <START:location> China’s <END> <START:organization> State Council Information office <END> shows <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> smiling as he looks down at the book .
Sporting a white cover with a painted image of <START:person> Mr. Xi’s <END> bust reminiscent of the famed portrait of <START:person> Mao Zedong <END> that hangs in <START:location> Tiananmen Square <END> , the text offered <START:person> Mr. Lu <END>, a longtime propagandist who rose through the ranks of <START:location> China’s <END> state-run <START:organization> Xinhua News Agency <END> , an easy conversation piece .
The book runs to 515 pages in English .
With the exception of a generous number of photos depicting Mr. Xi throughout his life , it might make tough reading , even for <START:organization> Communist Party <END> stalwarts .
<START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg <END> said he had bought the book for himself and co-workers to ensure that they “understood socialism with Chinese characteristics . ”
The book might give some <START:organization> Facebook <END> users pause , since the text includes a speech by <START:person> Mr. Xi <END> in which he says <START:location> Beijing <END> should “use Internet communication rules to advocate things wholesome and positive , and disseminate and put into practice the core socialist values , ” and “should properly handle timing , extent and efficiency to make our cyberspace wholesome and clean . ”
He also says , “It is a long-term task to ensure that online public opinion is healthy and sound . ”
The visit to <START:organization> Facebook <END> was part of a whirlwind tour in the <START:location> United States <END> for <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> , a trip that offered the contrast of coasts .
In <START:location> Washington <END> , <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> faced strong criticism from American officials over Chinese hacking attacks and skepticism about his vision for Internet governance .
On the <START:location> West Coast <END> , though , he received a warmer welcome from technology executives , including <START:person> Jeff Bezos <END> , chief executive of <START:organization> Amazon <END> , and <START:person> Timothy D. Cook <END> , the head of <START:organization> Apple <END>.
<START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> trip was followed closely in the Chinese news media ; in one broadcast on the <START:location> Hong Kong <END> -based <START:organization> Phoenix Television <END> , <START:organization> eBay’s <END> chief executive , <START:person> John Donahoe <END> , was shown discussing how crucial Chinese merchants were to the company .
Responding to reports of <START:person> Mr. Zuckerberg’s <END> meeting and his reference to <START:person> Mr. Xi’s <END> book , <START:person> Hu Jia <END> , a Chinese activist , said on Monday in a <START:organization> Twitter <END> post that <START:organization> Facebook <END> was “ risking repeating the mistakes of <START:organization> Yahoo <END> ” by becoming too close to the <START:organization> Chinese government <END> .
In 2004 , the Chinese journalist <START:person> Shi Tao <END> was arrested by Chinese officials after <START:organization> Yahoo <END> provided information about his account to the government .
The episode prompted <START:organization> Yahoo's <END> co-founder , <START:person> Jerry Yang <END> , to apologize to <START:person> Mr. Shi’s <END> family .
<START:person> Mr. Shi <END> served a prison sentence from 2005 to 2013 .
<START:organization> Facebook <END> did not respond to an email seeking comment on <START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> visit to the company .
The Chinese Internet market is huge .
A recent report by the research company <START:organization> IDC <END> projected that with more than 680 million people expected to be online in <START:location> China <END> next year , its market will account for 43 percent of worldwide growth in the technology sector .
That makes it an increasingly important place to be for American companies .
But strict barriers and regulations in <START:location> China <END>  keep many of them at arm’s length .
<START:organization> Linked In <END> , the professional social network , has decided to censor some content on its Chinese site .
<START:organization> Apple <END> has agreed to host some data within <START:location> China’s <END> borders , where Chinese officials could potentially gain access to it , and this year it put out a job advertisement for a head of law enforcement in the country .
The job posting read in part : “The role will be directly responsible for the management , handling and issuance of appropriate responses to requests from law enforcement authorities , public prosecutors and courts etc . throughout <START:location> China <END> . ”
During <START:person> Mr. Lu’s <END> visit in <START:location> Washington <END> , he met with members of the <START:organization> National Security Council <END> , who criticized continuing hackings against American companies and <START:location> China’s <END> top-down , government-led approach to managing the Internet , according to a senior American administration official who spoke on the condition that he not be named because the meetings were confidential .
The disagreement between the United States and <START:location> China <END> on such critical issues may provide one answer to why Mr. Lu gave equal emphasis to the <START:location> East Coast <END> and <START:location> West Coast <END> on his trip to the <START:location> United States <END>.
Meeting with <START:location> United States <END> technology companies provided <START:person> Mr. Lu <END> with ample photo opportunities to show off back home .
It also demonstrated that he could easily find eager partners in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , even as officials in <START:location> Washington <END> seek to play hardball .
