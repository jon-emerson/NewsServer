<START:person> Loc Tran <END> is a big man on campus at <START:organization> San Jose State University <END> in <START:location> Northern California <END> .
“A lot of people stop me when I’m walking , ” said <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> , a 19-year-old sophomore , who speaks in quick and confident bursts .
“They congratulate me . ”
But <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> is not a star on the football team , or a leader in student government .
He is a top player on the school’s competitive video game team , helping <START:organization> San Jose State <END> claw its way to victory in June over <START:organization> California State University , Fullerton <END> , in a tournament watched online by nearly 90,000 people .
When the new school year started this fall , classmates ’ heads swiveled toward him when professors said his name during roll call .
“ I thought that was pretty cool , ” <START:person> Mr. Tran <END> said .
Video game competitions , also known as e-sports , have taken off on campuses across the country , including <START:organization> Harvard <END> and <START:organization> Florida State University <END> .
More than 10,000 students now play in the biggest college league , 4,400 more than last year and 4,600 more than the number of men who play on Division I college basketball teams .
The stakes keep climbing , too : Winning a big tournament can sometimes earn players several years ’ worth of tuition money .
And in a possible sign of the future , the athletic department of <START:organization> Robert Morris University Illinois <END> in <START:location> Chicago <END> created an official video game team this fall , offering the same sort of scholarships given to athletes playing soccer , football and ice hockey .
While the college e-sports craze started as a grass-roots effort , game makers have quickly swooped in , propelling the sharp rise in interest .
The companies now underwrite scholarship prizes , offer team banners and provide organizational support , sensing a possible breeding ground for a new generation of superfans — people who not only play games but also consider them a spectator sport .
“Game developers are really waking up to the publicity power of these communities , ” said <START:person> T. L. Taylor <END> , an associate professor of comparative media studies at the <START:organization> Massachusetts Institute of Technology <END> , who has studied e-sports .
Colleges , meanwhile , are often standing at arm’s length .
While e-sports groups are often sanctioned clubs , receiving practice spaces from their schools , the leagues and competitions have few of the student regulations governing traditional college sports , like grade-point minimums or time limits on practicing .
The rise in e-sports has been so abrupt , many schools have not determined what to make of it .
<START:person> Carter Henderson <END> , a spokesman for the <START:organization> University of Washington’s <END> athletics program , said no one from the department was familiar enough with e-sports to discuss the topic .
The <START:organization> National Collegiate Athletic Association <END> , which oversees college athletics , said it had no comment about e-sports on campus .
Game companies say it is too early to predict how university administrations will become involved in e-sports .
“This is just how basketball was in the 1940s , ” said <START:person> Christopher Wyatt <END> , senior manager for North American publishing at <START:organization> Riot Games <END> .
“A lot of the structure and organization you see in more formal athletics , that groundwork is still being laid down here . ”
But it is unclear whether becoming a more formal part of a school would help or harm the growth of college e-sports .
The time commitment required for serious competitive gaming could lead to concerns about whether e-sports leave enough time for academic study .
In addition , formal recognition could diminish the autonomy that companies and teams have on campuses , bringing about rules like Title IX , the gender equity law .
About the possibility of more official recognition , <START:person> Dr. Taylor <END> said , “ I don’t think collegiate e-sports players are unified in any way that this is a good thing . ”
For game developers , however , the lure of being on campus is simple .
“We think that ’s where a lot of our players are , ” said <START:person> Michael Morhaime <END> , the chief executive and co-founder of <START:organization> Blizzard Entertainment <END> , which develops and publishes entertainment software .
In September , <START:organization> Blizzard <END> flew eight finalists from the <START:organization> College of Staten Island <END> , <START:organization> University of Massachusetts-Amherst <END> and other colleges to <START:location> Seattle <END> to compete for $ 5,000 in scholarship money in a tournament of <START:organization> Hearthstone <END> , a virtual card game from the company .
Last year , <START:organization> Azubu <END> , a games media company , sponsored a competition that awarded $ 40,000 in prize money to six students on a StarCraft II team from the <START:organization> University of California , Berkeley <END> .
Last February , <START:organization> Riot Games <END> hosted its first North American Collegiate Championship , something like the Final Four for <START:organization> League of Legends <END> , <START:organization> Riot’s <END> popular online battle game .
A team of five students from the <START:organization> University of Washington <END> won in front of a roaring audience at an e-sports studio that <START:organization> Riot <END> operates in <START:location> Manhattan Beach , Calif. <END> , with 169,000 more people watching online at the tournament’s peak .
The prize was $ 7,500 in scholarship money for each team member .
Riot recently announced that first-place winnings at the next championship , to be held in the spring , would rise to $ 30,000 , enough to pay for about three years of in-state tuition at the <START:organization> University of Washington <END>.
“A lot more people than I expected came forward and said , ‘I’d like to try out for the team , ’ ” said <START:person> Jackson Brown <END> , the manager of the <START:organization> University of Washington’s <END> team , the <START:organization> Purple Caster Minions <END> .
The growth of competitive gaming at colleges mirrors the broader rise of e-sports as entertainment .
A thriving international professional e-sports circuit routinely draws tens of thousands of spectators to stadiums for competitions , with millions more viewers online .
Top prizes for some events are now in the millions of dollars .
<START:organization> Twitch <END> , a video streaming service that made its name broadcasting e-sport matches , was acquired this year for close to $ 1 billion by <START:organization> Amazon <END> .
The college scene is largely organized around the <START:organization> Collegiate StarLeague <END> , which started at <START:organization> Princeton <END> in 2009 and is the biggest college league .
The organization is now active at 450 schools , up from 260 last year , according to <START:person> Duran Parsi <END> , the head of the league .
Many of those players also participate in matches organized by another collegiate league , <START:organization> IvyLoL <END> .
Large <START:location> West Coast <END> schools like the <START:organization> University of Washington <END> and <START:organization> University of British Columbia <END> tend to dominate the competitions .
The money that game companies are pouring into the college scene has persuaded many students to become much more serious about e-sports .
College scholarships from corporations , including <START:organization> Coca-Cola <END>, <START:organization> Ford <END> and <START:organization> Google <END> , have been around for decades , usually to encourage students to enter a particular field , like engineering .
The money that game companies are giving to students , in contrast , is meant to deepen the companies ’ relationship with a whole generation of players , one that is inseparable from their products .
Today , most professional players skip or delay college , because the college-age years are considered the prime period for players in the big leagues .
Playing at the professional level requires far too much time for practice and travel to tournaments to allow them to also attend school .
<START:person> Conan Liu <END> , a student at <START:organization> Berkeley <END> , took a year off from school to play StarCraft II professionally after his school team won the <START:organization> Azubu <END> championship .
<START:person> Mr. Liu <END> returned to school this fall to focus on pre-med studies because he did not perform as well as he had hoped in the pros .
While even bench warmers in the <START:organization> National Basketball Association <END> make more than $ 500,000 a year , the same is not true of professional gamers .
“You have to really be at the top , top to make a nice living , ” <START:person> Mr. Liu <END> said .
Game companies and collegiate league organizers predict that college e-sports could become a pipeline for the growing professional circuit .
Game companies say they are awarding scholarship money at college tournaments , rather than unrestricted cash prizes , to give students an incentive to continue their studies .
“We really want e-sports to become as ingrained in the academic environment as anything else — speech competitions , football competitions , ” said <START:person> Tyler Rosen <END> , president of the <START:organization> e-Sports Association <END> , which helps organize college events with the financial support of <START:organization> Blizzard Entertainment <END> .
A test of what happens when schools embrace e-sports started recently at <START:organization> Robert Morris University Illinois <END> .
The first 35 students to receive athletic scholarships under the school’s new e-sports program began training this fall in a room decked out with jet-black walls , mood lighting and leather gamer chairs with red piping .
The students , all <START:organization> League of Legends <END> players , are getting up to 50 percent of the price of tuition and room and board , which runs about $ 39,000 a year , according to <START:person> Kurt Melcher <END> , the university’s associate athletic director .
<START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> said he had received more than half a dozen calls from athletic directors at other universities who are interested in incorporating e-sports into their programs .
The idea came to <START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> , a gamer , this year after he started reading about the <START:organization> Collegiate StarLeague <END> .
A conversation with his wife dispelled any doubts he had about awarding athletic scholarships to gamers .
<START:person> Mr. Melcher <END> said his wife asked , “ Why should it only be given to some kid who can put a ball into a hole ? ”
