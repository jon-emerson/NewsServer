Cisco Systems on Friday filed a suit against Arista Networks , a networking switch company and fast-moving competitor , accusing it of copying large amounts of Cisco’s work .
Cisco contends that Arista violated 14 Cisco patents , some of which were based on work by Andreas Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton , Arista’s founders , when they were at Cisco .
The two men , well-respected engineers , sold a company , Granite Systems , to Cisco in 1996 .
They are also both billionaires , thanks in part to being the first two significant outside investors in Google .
The case , filed in the Federal District Court in Northern California , will probably go on for at least months .
Cisco is seeking Arista to withdraw essentially all of its crucial products from the market .
Cisco is also likely to seek damages , said Mark Chandler , the company ’s general counsel .
“We are not a litigious company , ” said Mr. Chandler .
“This was so blatant . ”
Cisco was filing suit , he said , because otherwise competing companies might also try to make use of Cisco products .
“ I am disappointed at Cisco’s tactics , ” said Jayshree Ullal , Arista’s chief executive , in a statement .
Ms. Ullal , also a Cisco veteran .
added , “it’s not the Cisco I knew . ”
Though the two companies have in the past consulted over various matters , persons familiar with the suit said Arista was unaware Cisco was planning the action .
Besides technical patents , Cisco says that Arista’s command line interface , a way of operating its switch , includes more than 500 of the commands used in Cisco gear .
Arista did this , Cisco says , in order to easily win over Cisco customers .
The suit quotes Kenneth Duda , another founder of Arista , along with Ms. Ullal , saying in interviews how much Arista resembles Cisco .
“They said it is comfortable for customers ” to use the same commands , Mr. Chandler said .
“They did it intentionally . ”
Cisco also included as evidence grammatical errors in Cisco user manuals that were identical in Arista manuals .
More than a decade ago , Cisco used similar documentation in a copying suit against the Chinese networking gear maker , Huawei .
That suit was eventually settled .
