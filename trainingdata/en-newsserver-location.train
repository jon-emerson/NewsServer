The Bank of Russia has raised its key interest rate to 17 percent from 10.5 percent in a move to boost its currency and rescue its troubled economy .
The action announced Tuesday in <START:location> Moscow <END> comes after the ruble 's value has fallen roughly 50 percent since January , battered by Western sanctions imposed over the conflict in <START:location> Ukraine <END> and plunging worldwide oil prices .
The falling ruble threatens to escalate <START:location> Russia <END> 's inflation to dangerous levels and paralyze the economy .
The central bank 's move illustrated the perils confronting <START:location> Russia <END> .
It reflected fears that the ruble 's decline could trigger consumer panic , incite a run on banks and deepen <START:location> Russia <END> 's economic problems .
By raising interest rates , the bank hopes investors will find it more financially appealing to keep their money in <START:location> Russia <END> .
" They did it as a lure to encourage people to keep their rubles at home rather than continue to flee the currency and the country , " said Barry Eichengreen , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley .
" It 's a way of buying time .
It does n't solve any of the underlying issues that the Russian economy has " — falling energy prices , Western sanctions and widespread corruption .
Such challenges are especially difficult because <START:location> Russia <END> 's economy relies so heavily on petroleum revenue and lacks the diversification to withstand severe economic downturns .
That tends to leave the economy at the mercy of global financial markets , where oil is priced in dollars .
The average price of a barrel of oil has dropped below $ 56 from a summer high of $ 107 .
The Russian government recently downgraded its growth forecast for next year , predicting that the economy will sink into recession .
Still , the Bank of Russia 's latest action carries dangers of its own .
By jacking up rates to try to contain inflation , it risks inflicting further economic damage , Eichengreen noted .
Though high interest rates can attract investor money , they can also stifle growth by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend .
The announcement in <START:location> Moscow <END> came after <START:location> U.S. <END> and European markets had closed Monday .
Stocks have suffered in recent days amid the steady drop in global oil prices .
The sell-off could continue if investors view the Bank of Russia 's move as ineffective .
The central bank has gradually raised the rate from 5.5 percent early this year .
Last Thursday , it tried unsuccessfully to stem the ruble 's slide by boosting its key rate by 1 percentage point to 10.5 percent .
It cited a surge in consumer prices and a " significant inflation risk . "
The Bank of Russia said then that it expected prices to rise 10 percent for 2014 and climb further in the first quarter of 2015 .
But the ruble plunged further Monday , dropping from 55 rubles to the dollar Thursday to about 65 rubles to the dollar .
A falling currency increases the cost of imports , thereby stoking inflationary pressures .
At the same time , plummeting oil prices give the government less money to combat a downturn and can force it to borrow more .
The sanctions imposed by the <START:location> West <END> have magnified <START:location> Russia <END> 's economic turmoil .
In September , the <START:location> United States <END> and the <START:location> European Union <END> announced a new round of sanctions over <START:location> Moscow <END> 's involvement in <START:location> Ukraine <END> , which included blocking Western financial markets to key Russian companies and limiting imports of some technologies .
The additional sanctions were expected to cause enough pain to put <START:location> Russia <END> into recession for one or two years , predicted economist Alexei Kudrin , who served as finance minister under President Vladimir Putin for 11 years until 2011 .
The potential for a prolonged downturn caused investors to pull their money from the country , causing the ruble to further lose value .

A local <START:location> Texas <END> police department has placed an officer on administrative duty following a Thursday scuffle with a 76-year-old man pulled over for allegedly displaying expired tags .
The motorist , Pete Vasquez , was stopped at an auto dealership—where he worked and had just pulled into .
He is seen exiting the vehicle—owned by the lot—to show the officer that the car has dealer plates .
He also tried to get the dealership manager 's attention .
The brutality by the 23-year-old officer , Nathanial Robinson , then ensues .
The officer is seen grabbing the man 's arm and wrestling him to the ground in a Nelson hold .
The two disappear from the dashcam 's site , and the officer then appears standing , having drawn his stun gun .
In the background is Drake 's " Under Ground Kings " blaring from the patrol car 's stereo , making it difficult to decipher the officer 's words in front of the vehicle .
The incident is one of many showing how dashcams , bodycams , and phone cameras are exposing alleged police brutality , especially in the wake of calls — from President Barack Obama on down —to outfit the nation 's police forces with body cameras in an effort to bring more public accountability to policing .
Immediately following the <START:location> Texas <END> brouhaha , an unnamed sergeant is overheard interviewing Vasquez .
J.J. Craig , the Victoria Police Department chief , told local media that the footage "raises some concerns " and that he opened an investigation into the incident after reviewing the tape .
The chief confirmed to the Victoria Advocate that Vasquez was , indeed , driving a vehicle with dealer tags , meaning the vehicle was exempt from being pulled over for expired tags .
The car lot 's sales manager told the Victoria Advocate that , during the incident , he said to the officer : " ' What in the hell are you doing ?
This gentleman is 76 years old , '" Larry Urich said .
" The cop told me to stand back , but I did n't shut up .
I told him he was a goddamned Nazi Stormtrooper . "
The victim , who was not charged with any crime , was briefly hospitalized and said he had some body aches .

For the first time in more than 140 years , the <START:location> US <END> has lost the title of the world 's largest economy - it has been stolen by <START:location> China <END> , according to the IMF.
But how reliable are the statistics underpinning this claim ?
The BBC 's economics editor , Robert Peston , explains lower down why <START:location> China <END> matters to all of us .
The Chinese economy is now worth $ 17.6tn , slightly higher than the $ 17.4tn the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) estimates for the <START:location> US <END> .
So for the first time since 1872 , when it overtook the UK, the <START:location> US <END> has been knocked off the top spot .
The IMF calculated these figures by using purchasing power parity ( PPP ) which enables you to compare how much you can buy for your money in different countries .
As money goes further in <START:location> China <END> than in the <START:location> US <END> , the figure for <START:location> China <END> is adjusted upwards .
Without the PPP adjustment , the IMF estimates that <START:location> China <END> 's economy is worth far less - $ 10.3tn .
But how much faith can be placed in the accuracy of GDP figures supplied by <START:location> China <END> when even the current premier , Li Keqiang has doubted their validity in the past ?
A declassified <START:location> US <END> diplomatic cable revealed that in 2007 , Li , who was then secretary general of <START:location> Liaoning Province <END> , had told the <START:location> US <END> ambassador that Chinese GDP statistics were "man-made " and " for reference only " .
But with a population of 1.36 billion people , <START:location> China <END> really should be the world 's largest economy , argues Matthew Crabbe , author of Myth-Busting <START:location> China <END> 's Numbers .
He 's spent more than 20 years looking at the country 's figures and the facts behind them .
His reaction to <START:location> China <END> 's new title : " So what ? "
He points out that if you look at per capita spending power - the value of all goods and services produced within a nation in a given year divided by the average population for the same year - then , even adjusted for PPP , <START:location> China <END> ( $ 11,868 ) is still lagging a long way behind not only the <START:location> United States <END> ( $ 53,001 ) but also the likes of <START:location> Turkmenistan <END> ( $ 12,863 ) and <START:location> Suriname <END> ( $ 16,080 ) .
So how easy is it to accurately measure the size of the Chinese economy or even just parts of it ?
Not very , says Crabbe .
" One of the key things that has to be understood is that distortions that happen at the village and provincial levels become amplified as they go out the statistical gathering chain .
" Year on year the GDP figures for each province grew faster than the national total , which logically and mathematically could not be . "
He attributes part of this discrepancy to corruption but also says that inaccuracies became exacerbated by the sheer size of the country and the rate at which it was growing .
Inaccurate GDP figures can have serious consequences for companies that base investment decisions on them .
Crabbe has a cautionary tale .
In 2005 the Chinese government readjusted its GDP figures and the statistics on which they were based , including retail sales .
The consensus in the retail community at the time was that nobody really understood the true size of the retail market in <START:location> China <END> .
" I went through each of the sectors to see what the real size of each of those would be , how fast they were growing and therefore what the real size of the retail market was .
" My conclusion was that the real retail market at that time was half the value of the official government figure , " he says .
Crabbe discovered there were problems with definitions of what retail goods actually were .
The government figures included wholesale sales of consumer goods , some government procurement , and some business to business sales - so not everything that had been included was strictly retail .
It 's difficult to gauge whether the accuracy of definitions and the data have really improved in recent years .
But the IMF forecasts growth of 7.4 % in <START:location> China <END> for 2014 and 7.1 % in 2015 , compared to <START:location> US <END> growth of 2.2 % this year and 3.1 % next year .
This means that the Chinese are unlikely to relinquish their number one status soon .
In fact the IMF predicts that by the end of this decade the Chinese economy will be worth $ 26.98tn - 20 % bigger than the <START:location> US <END> at $ 22.3tn .
But while the <START:location> US <END> held the top spot for 142 years , <START:location> China <END> may not be able to match that record - long term financial forecasts from the IMF and others indicate that by 2100 <START:location> India <END> could overtake them both .
The most important number in the world , for the past 30 years and next five years , is <START:location> China <END> 's growth rate .
For 30 years its economy grew at a mind-boggling rate - roughly 10 % a year but that stopped when the global economy hit problems in 2008 and it fell very sharply .
Then the Chinese government did something remarkable and persuaded its banks to lend as if there was no tomorrow .
They lent for investment and investment went up from an already extremely high 40 % or so of GDP , to about 50 % and the growth rate picked up again .
There 's been nothing like it in the history of capitalism .
It 's astonishing .
The Chinese have worked out that this new way of growing through debt funded investment rather than exports ca n't go on forever and is actually potentially quite dangerous .
So they are trying to reconstruct the economy but it 's not going desperately well and growth is now around 7 % .
I 'm not sure whether we can trust these numbers to be honest though .
I think most of us would say that if we 're slightly uneasy about most government statistics , then we 're profoundly uneasy about <START:location> China <END> 's statistics .
We do know that <START:location> China <END> is slowing down and there is a big debate about how fast that should be happening .
But the big story that has influenced all our lives in the last 30 years has been the economic revolution in <START:location> China <END> .
For years it improved our living standards by making the things we buy cheaper and cheaper .
It gulled central banks everywhere into thinking they had inflation under control so they kept interest rates way too low for too long .
<START:location> China <END> generated these enormous surpluses , which it then lent to the <START:location> US <END> to finance its colossal deficit .
<START:location> China <END> was the big economic force in the world - and it still is - but it 's moving in the opposite direction and the speed at which it slows down and the way that it slows down influences all our lives .
We should be under no illusion that the really big thing in the world , which will have an impact on our living standards is what happens in <START:location> China <END> .
Nothing else really matters in comparison .

Joint commission meetings will be held as early as next year , it was decided during Prime Minister Najib Razak’s meeting with His counterpart Sheikh Hasina at his <START:location> Putra Jaya <END> office on Wednesday .
The two sides will discuss ways to close trade gaps and to reach an agreement on free trade , said Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque .
“The Malasian prime minister said ‘we already enjoy a very good relationship with <START:location> Bangladesh <END> .
We want to take it to greater heights’ . ”
“There aren’t any irritants between us , he said .
He began speaking by saying he wants to better our relationship , ” Haque added .
<START:location> Malasia <END> exports nearly $ 2 billion worth goods to <START:location> Bangladesh <END> while $ 135 million worth goods goes to the Southeast Asian country from <START:location> Bangladesh <END> .
Haque told reporters that both countries had agreed in enhancing trade and commerce as the present rate of business was disproportionately imbalanced and in favour of <START:location> Malasia <END> .
He said the Malasian prime minister recognised the issue and indicated that initiatives would be taken to reduce the gap .
Razak greeted Hasina when her motorcade reached <START:location> Pardana Putra <END> from <START:location> Hotel Grand Hyatt <END> , where a red carpet and honour guards awaited the <START:location> Bangladesh <END> premier .
The two heads of government held discussions after the initial formalities at the <START:location> Perdana <END> meeting room , where two MoUs , an agreement and a protocol for exporting more workers from <START:location> Bangladesh <END> were signed .
<START:location> Malasia <END> , a large manpower market for <START:location> Bangladesh <END> , currently has about 600,000 Bangladeshis employed at various sectors .
The protocol signed on Wednesday would create jobs for 12,000 more workers from <START:location> Bangladesh <END> initially and in phases 60,000 workers would be recruited .
<START:location> Bangladesh <END> has been proposing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA ) with <START:location> Malasia <END> for a long time .
The foreign secretary said Razak agreed to start negotiations on the proposal .
" I think it 's a big step , " said Haque .
Hasina during the meeting had urged Razak to widen the quota-and duty-free access of Bangladeshi goods , chiefly pharmaceuticals , jute goods , cement and footwear , in <START:location> Malasia <END> .
The Malasian premier also assured her on the issue .
The last meeting of the joint commission , formed for better cooperation , was held in <START:location> Dhaka <END> in 2005 .
Secretary Haque said <START:location> Malasia <END> had agreed to convene the next meeting there in 2015 .
He said Hasina proposed to form a Bangladesh-Malasia investment forum .
" The issue will be discussed in the next joint commission meeting . "

European stocks dropped for a seventh day , erasing earlier gains , as banks and energy companies fell .
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.8 percent to 320.59 at 12:08 p.m. in <START:location> London <END> after climbing as much as 0.7 percent .
Earlier , it lost as much as 1.2 percent as factory data from <START:location> China <END> and <START:location> France <END> missed economists ’ forecasts .
European stocks erased their 2014 gains yesterday , with the Stoxx 600 closing at its lowest level since Oct. 20 .
After rallying 13 percent from this year’s low to an almost seven-year high on Dec. 5 , the index tumbled 7.9 percent in the past six days , dragged down by energy shares .
“There is n’t a positive trigger to vanish the current fear of a major impact due to the drop in oil prices , ” said Guillermo Hernandez Sampere , who helps manage about 130 million euros ( $ 163 million ) at MPPM EK in <START:location> Eppstein , Germany <END> .
“The hope for a year-end rally is very little , too many issues need to be resolved in the near term , to switch back to risk-on mode . ”
Societe Generale SA and ING Groep NV slid more than 3 percent , pushing a gauge of bank shares down 1.4 percent for the worst performance among 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600 .
Premier Oil Plc and Technip SA declined at least 1.8 percent , helping send a gauge of oil and gas stocks down for a seventh day .
Crude extended losses , trading below $ 55 a barrel for the first time since May 2009 , amid speculation that <START:location> U.S. <END> producers may further increase output as they battle OPEC for market share .
Repsol SA ( REP ) dropped 3.4 percent after saying it will buy Talisman Energy Inc. for $ 8 per common share in a cash deal .
Orange SA rose 1.3 percent after BT Group Plc started exclusive talks to acquire EE , the British wireless venture it owns with Deutsche Telekom AG , for 12.5 billion pounds ( $ 19.6 billion ) .

Back to the beginning

Fourteen years ago at the University of California’s flagship campus , a similar mob , including many looking like they had crawled out from under a dock in the marina at the end of University Avenue , drowned my words with shouts of “murderer , ” “racist , ” and “Nazi . ”
They attempted to rip the microphone cord from the wall .
A hirsute man “mooned ” me .
And , in one last indignity , the hecklers seized my writings to fuel an actual book burning .
This all happened under the watchful eyes of two pleasant Cal policewomen , who intervened only when a frustrated man petitioned the hecklers to permit me to speak .
Indeed , during the event the organizers asked me to note the just-discovered presence of the officers in hopes that it might bring order .
“They’ve been here the whole time , ” mocked a heckler .
“We f---ing invited the police . ”
Back then , Mumia Abu-Jamal , a cab driver who murdered a <START:location> Philadelphia <END> cop in 1981 , served as the rationale to shout down an invited speaker .
On Wednesday , Eric Garner and Michael Ferguson , two African Americans killed in encounters with the police under very different circumstances , gave the protestors an excuse to silence an invited guest--and commit violence and the destruction of property in the city surrounding the campus this past week .
The student censors in 2000 and 2014 failed to grasp their own irony .
In my case , a protestor held aloft a sign reading “Fight Racist Censorship ” as he marched around a bonfire containing copies of my 44-page booklet , Cop Killer : How Mumia Abu-Jamal Conned Millions into Believing He Was Framed .
In Thiel’s case , the billionaire reportedly readied to answer a question on political speech when the mob silenced his speech .
Between the book burning I experienced and the heckler’s veto Peter Thiel endured , that parochial inability to step outside of their shoes to understand the hypocrisy they project played out in the shameful prevention of Benjamin Netanyahu from speaking on campus in 2000 , the 2001 mass thefts of newspapers containing an ad from David Horowitz criticizing the notion of slavery reparations for African Americans , the firebombing of the home of school chancellor Robert Birgeneau in 2009 by activists shouting— What else ? —“ No justice , no peace , ” and the effort this fall to revoke an invitation for comedian Bill Maher to address the school’s graduates .
The home of the Free Speech Movement of the 1960s now serves as the focal point of campus intolerance .
The unfortunate development has its roots in the self-righteous radicals who championed the Free Speech Movement a half century ago .
In the fall of 1964 , Mario Savio applied lessons learned in the civil-rights movement in the <START:location> Deep South <END> to <START:location> Berkeley <END> .
Activists wished to allow off-campus groups to proselytize their views on public walkways .
The school , seeing itself as an institution of higher learning rather than a political convention , balked .
Savio implored students to “put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels ” of the machine , i .e . , the University of California-Berkeley .
The machine arrested Savio that December as he agitated for expanded speech .
Less than two years later , the cops arrested Savio for trying to muzzle the speech of military recruiters seeking to meet with interested students on the <START:location> Berkeley <END> campus .
“ Free speech for me—but not for thee , ” as Nat Hentoff would say .
The figurehead of the Free Speech Movement misunderstood his campus movement to the point of delusion .
“Last summer I went to <START:location> Mississippi <END> to join the struggle there for civil rights , ” Savio explained .
“This fall I am engaged in another phase of the same struggle , this time in <START:location> Berkeley <END> . ”
Affluent students weren’t the equivalent of oppressed blacks , <START:location> Sproul Hall <END> was n’t the <START:location> Edmund Pettus Bridge <END> , and <START:location> Berkeley <END> police officers weren’t Ku Klux Klan Kleagles , or , as Savio maintained , American versions of Adolf Eichmann .
The sanctimony unleashed by the conflation of every campus controversy into a life-and-death struggle for justice predictably resulted in a complete disregard for the rights of others .
This month , fifty years after Mario Savio used a police car as a platform and a bullhorn as a microphone , journalists chronicled the Free Speech Movement on its own terms rather than as a euphemism for radical rule-or-ruinism .
“ I think about the Free Speech Movement as helping to end the McCarthy era , ” NYU professor Robert Cohen told the AP in a story commemorating the anniversary of the <START:location> Berkeley <END> unrest , which , incidentally , occurred exactly a decade after the <START:location> Wisconsin <END> politician’s formal condemnation by the U.S. Senate .
The delusion of the FSM’s leading man proved contagious .
Even mobs burning books or attempting to burn a physicist-cum-administrator’s home can’t shake the notion that <START:location> Berkeley <END> somehow means what John Peter Zengler does .
As Peter Thiel discovered this week , you get to speak at Berkeley—if the audience agrees .

<START:location> Ohio Street <END> , once pitted and cracked , now has fresh asphalt – along with a bike trail and new streetlights being hooked up – after an $ 11 million project to turn it into an <START:location> Outer Harbor <END> gateway .
Now attention turns to transforming the blighted area surrounding the old industrial street into a vibrant neighborhood .
That is what a couple of established developers look to do , with projects to build luxury apartments , an office building and boat docks along the <START:location> Buffalo River <END> .
For years , dump trucks , cement mixers and tractor-trailers made up most of the traffic passing through the once-industrial area , so it could be tough to ride a bicycle on the road .
But the planned rowing club , park and housing developments figure to draw more people .
And a 12-foot-wide bike trail along the road will be attractive to cyclists .
The idea , of course , is that the improvements will resuscitate the area .
Carl Paladino said he expects to begin building three or four apartment buildings , each three or four stories high , next year .
The developer said boat docks and window views would make his apartments , on six acres of land , something special .
“We want to get the buildings in the air as much as possible to gain the nice visuals down there , and we are creating boat docks for tenants who want to have their boats parked outside their apartments , ” Paladino said .
“This will be a significant improvement for the river and the neighborhood . ”
Paladino also plans a two - or three-story office building on five acres of land across the street , with construction beginning when he finds a tenant .
Sam Savarino plans 78 luxury apartments in a five-story building at <START:location> Ohio <END> and South streets , also with boat docks .
Next month he intends to tear down the former Erie Freight House , near the <START:location> Ohio Street Bridge <END> , ahead of the spring groundbreaking , with the project’s completion targeted for spring 2016 .
“It’s exciting to be down there .
All the other developments will only make it better on Ohio Street , ” Savarino said .
Rep. Brian Higgins , D-Buffalo , and Tom Dee , president of Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp. , cite <START:location> Ohio Street’s <END> improvement as an example of how investment in infrastructure can lead to further waterfront development .
The <START:location> Ohio Street <END> project is intended to create an attractive link between the <START:location> Inner and Outer Harbors <END> .
The project , which is due to be completed by June 2015 , is transforming the 1.4-mile road between <START:location> Michigan Avenue <END> and <START:location> Fuhrmann Boulevard <END> into a two-lane parkway with bike and pedestrian paths , along with attractive landscaping and decorative lighting and signage .
Federal funds are paying for 80 percent of the $ 11 million gateway project , with the City of Buffalo and the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp. also contributing .
Infrastructure improvements from <START:location> Michigan Avenue <END> to <START:location> Canalside <END> are also planned .
The street’s first sign of revival came in 2011 , with the opening of <START:location> Buffalo RiverFest Park <END> .
Since then , a cluster of grain elevators known as <START:location> Silo City <END> on <START:location> Childs Street <END> , off <START:location> Ohio <END> , has become an arts destination .
In addition , Buffalo RiverWorks can be found on the other side of the river , where hockey and curling on two rinks began taking place last week .
The 6,000-capacity entertainment and events center , which also will include roller derby , will be formally unveiled in February , followed by the opening of a brewery and malting facility later in the year on the <START:location> Ganson Street <END> site .
Paladino held onto the land on which he is now planning to build housing for three decades .
Why develop the land now ?
Paladino said the return of young people and empty-nesters to cities like <START:location> Buffalo <END> triggered the planned development .
“The market has improved for residential development .
It’s fairly good right now for apartments , ” Paladino said .
“Young people – and it ’s just a trend thing – they’ve had it with … mowing lawns and all that .
They want the urban life they see on TV , and to live approximate to things . ”
Paladino said he hopes the mostly vacant Commodore Perry housing complex nearby will eventually be torn down .
“We’re just praying that they don’t rehab those apartments and put people back in them .
Hopefully , they will get rid of the whole thing and tear it down .
That <START:location> Perry Street <END> has caused a lack of interest in any development there . ”
Paladino’s plan to erect an office building follows this year’s $ 1 million remediation of the contaminated land where a gas station stood .
“We’re planning a nice two - or three-story building – how big depends on the tenants .
We first have to solidify the tenancy , and then it ’s likely we’ll start as soon as possible , ” Paladino said .
The Buffalo Scholastic Rowing Association ’s new Patrick Paladino Memorial Boathouse – named for Carl Paladino’s late son – is being built on land the developer leases to the group .
The boathouse property is just south of Paladino’s planned residential development , across from Father Conway Park .
While pleased that improvements were made to <START:location> Ohio Street <END> , Paladino criticized the decision to make it two lanes .
“They made a big mistake by making it into a two-way highway when it should have been a four-lane .
It’s a terrible mistake .
You can’t park a car .
And if you’re on it and stuck in traffic , you can’t even turn around .
And they’re talking about it being one of the feeders to the <START:location> Outer Harbor <END> , ” Paladino said .
But he reserved most of his ire for the bicycle lane .
“How many people are riding bikes in this community ?
For four or five months a year you can’t ride a bike in the snow .
If you want to ride a bike , do it on the sidewalk .
That’s why they have sidewalks , ” he said .
Savarino’s project , named Buffalo River Landing , calls for covered parking on the property’s ground level , with housing units on the next four levels , including two office spaces on the second floor .
Savarino plans to salvage timber from the Erie Freight House , if possible , to be used for decorative purposes , with iron beams refastened as exterior benches .
Corten steel would be used with masonry and translucent panels for the stairways to mimic some of the industrial architecture around the river’s edge , he said .
The original foundation would be kept as a promenade .
A patio and green space are planned between the building and the water .
Savarino said units would cost up to $ 2,700 a month for a large two-bedroom corner unit with a rooftop porch , with the lowest-priced apartments renting for around $ 800 .
He remains open to allowing the units to become condominiums in the future .
The leases would give tenants the option of keeping the unit should that happen .
He said he’s anxious to get started .
“People say to us that it ’s exciting that there are developments in <START:location> Buffalo <END> that are taking advantage of our location by the water , ” Savarino said .
“You don’t see enough of that . ”

Faced with the dilemma of what to get loved ones for Christmas , we now turn to Dell SecureWorks ’ just-published 2014 Underground Hacking Markets Report , a handy shopping guide for cybercriminals .
SecureWorks researchers Joe Stewart and David Shear examined dozens of underground hacker markets for their second annual survey and found that business is booming .
Prices have gone down for many items , and the offerings have expanded .
As the report puts it : “ Underground hackers are monetizing every piece of data they can steal or buy and are continually adding services so other scammers can successfully carry out online and in-person fraud . ”
For the newbie hacker , a new offering this year : online tutorials on topics such as “Basic Carding ” and “How to do ATM Hacks and Get Much More Money than you Withdraw ” can be had for as little as $ 1 a pop .
A manual covering a broader range of skills runs about $ 30.
How about a new identity for the New Year ?
For $ 250 , you can buy a scan of a working Social Security card and the name and address of the card holder ; for another $ 100 , you’ll also get a scan of a utility bill for extra authenticity .
A driver’s license to match costs $ 100 to $ 150 .
Armed with that information , a hacker can apply for government assistance programs , bank accounts , and credit cards .
The cost for Remote Access Trojans , a type of malicious software that gives cybercriminals control of computers , has dropped considerably from last year because there are so many free ones now available online .
The price tags range from $ 20 to $ 50 , down from $ 50 to $ 250 last year , according to the report .
And , SecureWorks reports , the going price if you want someone to hack into a website for you is $ 100 to $ 200 , compared with $ 100 to $ 300 last year .
Not everything is cheaper .
The price of access to infected networks of computers , called botnets—they’re handy in all sorts of nefarious pursuits , including sending spam and malicious software —has gone up .
Last year , it cost about $ 90 to rent a botnet of 5,000 computers .
This year , the market has gotten more segmented and a bit pricier .
Specify a location for where you want your infected computers to be and pay accordingly .
For 5,000 bots in the <START:location> U.S. <END> , you’ll pay $ 600 to $ 1,000 ; for the same number in the <START:location> U.K. <END> , it ’s $ 400 to $ 500 .
The price difference can be explained , in part , by the fact that any credit card data found on U.K.-based bots is likely more secure and harder to use , Stewart and Shear explain .
The other takeaway from this year’s survey is a focus on the customer .
Fine purveyors of cybercrime services know that one way to distinguish themselves in a crowded market is good customer service .
The underground is awash in premium credit cards , after a bumper crop of massive breaches this year , and numerous sellers now advertise “Satisfaction Guaranteed ” on the data they’re selling .

Spanish company Repsol was rumoured to be the frontrunner to take over Talisman , <START:location> Canada <END> 's fifth-largest independent oil producer .
Talisman Energy Inc. based in <START:location> Calgary <END> says it has agreed to be purchased by Spanish energy giant Repsol in a transaction worth about $ 15.1 billion Cdn ( $ 13 billion US) .
Under the agreement confirmed early Tuesday by Talisman , Repsol will acquire all outstanding common shares of Talisman at $ 9.33 Cdn ( $ 8 US) each .
Repsol will also take on about $ 5.48 billion Cdn ( $ 4.7 billion US) of debt .
Talisman shares had closed at $ 5.97 Cdn on the Toronto Stock Exchange , up 93 cents or more than 18 per cent .
The purchase price , which includes Talisman 's debt , represents a 75 per cent premium to the seven-day volume weighted average share price .
Also under the deal , Talisman will pay aggregate cash dividends of 18 cents per common share prior to closing .
The Talisman board is recommending shareholders accept the deal at a special meeting to be held in mid-February 2015 .
Completion of the transaction , which is targeted to close in the second quarter of 2015 , is subject to customary closing conditions , including court approval .
" This deal creates significant and immediate value for Talisman stakeholders , " said board chairman Chuck Williamson .
" Repsol is a world-class operator with a solid track record and the financial capability to continue the development of these assets within their international portfolio . "
Talisman has strong operational capability , a highly skilled work force and we look forward to leveraging their expertise as we partner to create a stronger , more profitable and competitive organization , " said Repsol chairman Antonio Brufau .
Repsol is an oil and gas giant with a presence in more than 30 countries , employing more than 24,000 people .
The combined company will be among the 15 largest privately-owned oil and gas companies with activity in more than 50 countries and more than 27,000 employees .
Repsol said Talisman 's incorporation will increase Repsol 's output by 76 per cent to 680,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day , and boost reserves by 55 per cent .
According to a Bloomberg report , the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was also said to be weighing a bid for Talisman .
Analysts have predicted the pace of mergers and acquisition in the oil patch will pick up as low oil prices put pressure on some names , especially those with high debt loads .
<START:location> U.S. <END> benchmark crude for January delivery dropped below $ 56 US on Monday , down more than 47 per cent over the past six months .
Talisman , which over the past few years has been striving to better focus its global portfolio , has long been the subject of takeover speculation .
While its offshore assets in <START:location> Southeast Asia <END> and its position in several North American shale regions are seen to be attractive to potential bidders , its holdings in the <START:location> U.K. North Sea <END> have been cited as a hindrance to any potential deals as they 've been prone to unplanned outages and have struggled to meet targets .

There 's an update to a story reported Monday about a self-described Wall Street whiz kid .
Mohammed Islam said he made $ 72 million investing on the stock market in a New York Magazine interview published this week .
However , after a flurry of attention Monday , the teen said he made it all up , reports CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller
The rumors of Mohammed 's self-made million dollar fortune reportedly began at his high school late last year .
That 's when the 17-year-old from Queens realized he would turn those rumors into an elaborate , exaggerated lie .
In an online video for the Leaders Investment Club , Mohammed Islam appeared to be a young professional with a knack for picking stocks .
" From an early age , I 've always had an interest in finance and entrepreneurship , " he said in the video .
" Having earned reputable returns over the past years , I 'm glad to say that trading is a passion . "
Instagram photos show the 17-year-old easily making friends .
As the investment club president at the prestigious Stuyvesant High School , he even presented a lecture about his supposed financial prowess .
But in an interview with the New York Observer , the self-described teen tycoon admitted it 's all a sham :
" You seem to be quoted saying 'eight figures . '
That 's not true , is it ? "
" No . "
" Is there any figure ?
Have you invested and made returns at all ? "
" No . "
" So it 's total fiction ? "
" Yes . "
New York Observer editor Ken Kurson interviewed Mohammed and his friend , Damir Tulemaganbetov , who also took part in the hoax .
" I think that he wanted to impress people and he told a few fibs and got this reputation as this master investor and once that reputation is rolling how do you unwind it ? "
Kurson said .
In this week 's issue of New York Magazine , Mohammed is ranked "number 12 " of "reasons to love New York " because he "made $ 72 million trading stocks on his lunch break . "
" We want to create a brotherhood , " Mohammed told the New York Magazine reporter over a round of "freshly squeezed apple juice . "
" Like the Koch brothers , " he said .
" Like in ' Wolf of Wall Street . "
Damir added .
New York Magazine has since retracted the story 's title and the online article contains an editor 's note which states , " Our story portrays the $ 72 million figure as a rumor .
Mohammed provided bank statements that showed he is worth eight figures , and he confirmed on the record that he 's worth eight figures . "
" People want stories , they want them fast , but they also want them right and there is tension between getting them up there quickly and getting them up there correctly , " Kurson said .
In a statement to "CBS This Morning , " representatives for Mohammed said his millions are about as real as " Monopoly money . "
CBS News reached out to New York Magazine for a statement and have not received a response .
Mohammed said he 's especially sorry for embarrassing his family .

The $ 2 million donation is the single largest contribution to date ; the family has contributed over $ 4 million to Summa Health .

" We feel this gift is an investment in their future so that many others may also benefit from the outstanding care that Summa provides . "

Tech companies primed to go public next year saw a surge in mega funding rounds in 2014 , as the number of $ 100 million or more financing deals more than doubled to 50 this year , according to the analytics firm CB Insights .
And as mega rounds soar , so do billion-dollar valuations for venture-backed tech companies .
The number of private <START:location> U.S. <END> tech companies valued at $ 1 billion or more in the IPO pipeline has grown more than 50 percent since last year , said CB Insights .
Currently , 40 companies in the 2015 tech IPO pipeline have raised a venture capital financing round at a real or rumored valuation of $ 1 billion .
That 's up from 25 a year ago .
Some of these include Vice , Gilt , Palantir , Pinterest , Square and SnapChat .
" The amount of money going into the private markets and the big valuations in the private market , the magnitude of it is larger than even we expected , " said Anand Sanwal , co-founder and CEO of CB Insights .
There are 588 venture and private equity-backed tech companies in the 2015 tech IPO pipeline , according to a CB Insights report .
These companies all boast a real or rumored valuation of more than $ 100 million .
To date , these tech firms have raised a whopping $ 64 billion across more than 2,700 deals .
The tech IPO market looks like it will keep its momentum in 2015 , Sanwal said .
" December has been a fairly strong month for tech IPOs , so we are ending the year strong which is likely a good thing for how 2015 is going to look .
Of course with the public markets , if sentiment shifts drastically that can all change , but for the time being now things look very promising and favorable , " he said .
" If there is one thing that may suppress IPO activity it 's just that there is so much money available in private market that there is not that much pressure for these companies to go public , necessarily . "
The venture firm with the most companies in its portfolio that are in CB Insight 's tech IPO pipeline is Kleiner Perkins .
However , Sequoia Capital has backed the most companies with billion dollar plus valuations .

<START:location> Russia <END> 's central bank has not only been raising interest rates , but has spent nearly $ 90 billion trying to defend the ruble and prevent prices spiraling out of control .
But investors are growing increasingly alarmed about the prospects for the Russian economy .
The Bank of Russia said Monday that the country could sink into a deep recession next year if oil prices remain at $ 60 a barrel .
GDP could contract by as much as 4.7 % in 2015 , and then by a further 1.1 % in 2016 unless oil prices pick up .

<START:location> Washington <END> ( CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs misled Congress and members of the media about how many veterans died or suffered serious harm as a result of extreme treatment delays , according to a new report by the department 's top watchdog .
The VA shared a fact sheet in April with Congress and the press that said 23 veterans died and a total of 76 suffered serious harm throughout the nation while waiting months or years for health care since 1999 .
But the report released Monday by the VA 's Office of Inspector General highlights multiple errors with these findings and a lack of evidence for statements the VA released about them .
Amongst the misleading facts highlighted in the report , the VA overstated the timeframe of its review by eight years , since the VA said it examined unresolved requests for health care since 1999 , but in reality only examined requests dating back to 2007 .
Moreover , the inspector general says there may have been "overstatements or understatements " about the number of deaths or illnesses resulting from delays at specific VA hospitals and that the fact sheet contained a number of other errors .
These errors also included an incident reported to have occurred at one VA facility when it actually happened at another , and the number of "institutional disclosures " -- where the VA admitted delays caused severe harm -- as being overstated at one facility .
The report raises questions about how many veterans may have had their appointments erased by VA staff before they received treatment .
The VA reported that between September 2012 and April 2014 , the number of appointments delayed more than 90 days dropped from 2 million to less than 300,000 , but the inspector general found that the VA did not document how staff members were closing these appointments and did not ensure veterans received the care they were waiting for .
As a result , the inspector general could not determine what happened to 1.7 million appointments .
VA leaders , including a top VA health official , Dr. Thomas Lynch , shared many of these statistics on patient deaths and harm during a congressional staff briefing on April 7 and repeated them at a House Committee on Veterans ' Affairs hearing on April 9 .
Rep. Jeff Miller , R-Florida , the committee chairman , described the errors as either intentionally deceitful or grossly incompetent .
"VA 's statistics regarding the number of veterans harmed by department delays in care are almost certainly wildly inaccurate and we may never know the actual number of veterans affected by gaps in the VA system that existed for years , " Miller said in a statement Monday .
" Accountability for the VA leaders responsible for misleading Congress and the public on this important matter is sorely needed , " he added .
Miller also said the VA eventually contradicted itself in correspondence with the House committee by saying a review of delayed requests for health care dating back to 1999 would not be possible .
The VA previously issued an apology for the misleading and incorrect statements saying , "VA inadvertently caused confusion in its communication on this complex set of reviews that were ongoing at the time .
For that , we apologize .
There was no intent to mislead anyone with respect to the scope or findings of these reviews . "
A separate VA audit released in June found that about 57,000 newly enrolled veterans were waiting at least 90 days for medical care and that almost 64,000 who enrolled in the past decade requested , but never received , appointments .
VA Secretary Robert McDonald has since taken steps to reform the embattled agency by creating new partnerships with private organizations , giving veterans greater access to private health care and establishing a VA-wide customer service office , among other programs .

In the spy thriller , " surprisingly intimate " concrete rooms are practically characters in and of themselves .
The spy HQ , what with its "rough , ribbed-concrete walls , " takes the harshest parts of the style and inhabits it with real human being feelings again .

Architect Chris Downey is standing next to a pile of Sheetrock , balancing a white cane in the air like a tightrope walker 's pole .
The week before , construction had begun on a new office for the Independent Living Resource Center of <START:location> San Francisco <END> , or ILRC , a nonprofit community center for people with disabilities .
Downey holds the cane up to approximate for the center 's executive director , Jessie Lorenz , how the reception desk will jut out at an angle from a concrete column .
Lorenz takes a step , and a pile of pipes on the floor clatters .
" I do n't know what 's over there , " says Downey .
Lorenz giggles .
" I hope I did n't break anything , " she says .
Lorenz regains her footing and touches the cane .
" That makes sense , " she says .
" It 's almost like we 're funneling people into this part . "
Even though Lorenz , who , like Downey , is blind , ca n't see the space before her , she knows exactly what to expect .
On her desk at the ILRC 's current office on Mission Street , she keeps a tactile floor plan that Downey printed for her .
The plan 's fine web of raised lines looks like an elaborate decorative pattern , suggesting a leaf of handmade stationery or a large sheet from which doilies are about to be cut .
Though Downey has consulted on other architects ' projects since going blind six years ago , this one marks a turning point for him .
The community center is the first space he 's designed since losing his sight .
The center recently opened its doors to the public with a celebration to inaugurate the new space , located on <START:location> Howard Street <END> in the city 's <START:location> Yerba Buena <END> district , just down the block from the <START:location> Moscone convention center <END> .
But on this May afternoon , the walls are just beginning to go up .

Lorenz and her guide dog , a German shepherd named Phoenix , head deeper into the building to check out the storage room , and Downey makes his way to the storefront , where the conference room looks out onto <START:location> Howard <END> .
Other than a few scant rays of afternoon sunlight slanting in through the window , it 's dark .
The floor is scattered with the guts of the future office—cables , pipes , and more Sheetrock—obstacles Downey weaves around with his cane .
There 's sort of a ropes-course , trust-fall quality to touring a dimly lit construction site with someone who ca n't see .
He tells me where we are , and I tell him where not to step .
Downey makes his way to the open office area , where cubicles will eventually go .
At 51 , he is tall , trim , and nearly bald , with a light fuzz of whitening hair just above his ears and intensely blue eyes .
Downey gave up his daily bike commute when he lost his sight , but he still moves with the assurance of someone who could hop on a bicycle and take off at any moment .
He pauses , listens , and makes a few exploratory taps on the floor with his cane .
" I was trying to see if they had framed up the wall between the conference room and the" —more tapping —" Yeah , this is it , " he says as he finds the wall with his cane .
" The windows will sit here .
It 's a pretty good-size opening to get that light and view into the general office . "
Downey is gesturing at the street and making eye contact as he says this , and for a moment this feels like any other construction tour .
Then the front door swings open and Dwight Ashdown , principal of the <START:location> San Francisco <END> firm Ashdown Architecture and Downey 's partner on the project , strides in .
He reaches around the side of an unfinished wall and flips a switch .
Light floods the space as the overhead lights flicker to life .
No one had thought to turn them on .
For most of his life , Chris Downey could see .
Seven years ago , he started to notice blind spots in his vision .
At the time , he was managing the architectural practice of a green modular-housing firm in <START:location> Oakland <END> and cycling 100 miles a week .
He began to have trouble following the ball during baseball games with his son , Renzo .
After new glasses did n't fix the problem , an MRI revealed a benign tumor pressing on his optic nerve .
His own father , a physician , had died of complications from a brain tumor at the age of 36 , when Downey was seven .
On St . Patrick 's Day , 2008 , Downey checked into the hospital .
It took the doctors nine and a half hours to remove the tumor .
When he woke up , the world was blurry .
He could distinguish Renzo and his wife , Rosa , as colors and shapes but could not make out the details of their faces .
At first , this was a sign of normal recovery .
But the next day , the bottom half of Downey 's visual field was dark , as though he were partly submerged in ink .
The day after , even the blurred vision was gone , replaced by changing sensations of light and dark .
By the fifth day , everything had gone black .
After the doctors told him there was nothing more they could do , a social worker came by his hospital room to talk about the future .
" One of the first things she commented on was that I was an architect , and we could talk about career 'alternatives ' —that was her word , " Downey recalls .
" After that I did n't hear much else . "
[ Downey and Lorenz adjust floorplans . ]
Even though leaving architecture felt wrong , staying seemed equally preposterous .
" I questioned it initially , like—how ? " says Downey .
No sooner had he asked the question than he began to think of answers .
Quite a few of his job duties were supervisory—managing relationships , helping his staff think through design problems—and he could handle those without being able to see .
Downey approached his bosses .
" When I pitched the idea , ' Can I come back ? ' they were quick to say yes , " he says .
" They were absolutely sure that I 'd be able to figure it out ."
Within a month , he was back at the firm part-time .
Rosa Downey , who is also an architect ( the couple met as junior designers at the <START:location> Boston <END> firm Schwartz/Silver Architects in 1987 ) , drove him to work every day .
Since he did n't have command of a cane yet , Downey spent his days either in his chair or being led around the office by colleagues .
That fall , a technology trainer he was working with found him an embossing printer —a specialty technology normally used in educational settings to print braille and tactile graphics .
With a good bit of tinkering , Downey and his trainer got it to print floor plans from PDFs .
It was a lucky fluke .
The PDF format is common currency in the architecture profession , and having a piece of technology that could read it meant he could participate without asking anyone to adopt another technology .
But Downey still had no way of getting his own ideas onto paper .
The language of the industry he had worked in for 20 years was trapped on inscrutably flat pieces of paper or locked away in electrons on a screen .
Lorenz , who first learned of Downey through a mutual friend , recalls talking with him after he lost his sight .
" There are a lot of people that would 've just been like , 'OK , this is an opportunity to change career paths , '" she says .
" It was clear to me early on that packing up shop was n't on his list of options for himself . "
Downey saw his blindness as a particularly gnarly design problem—a high-stakes version of the intentionally mindboggling assignments from his graduate student days at the University of California , Berkeley 's College of Environmental Design .
" You get that incredible challenge in school , where you 're scratching your head , like , ' Oh my God , where 's this going to take me ? ' says Downey .
" That can be incredibly terrifying . "
But he does n't sound like a person shaped by terror .
Instead , the thought of being asked to do something ridiculously hard seems to make him giddy .
A few months after going back to work , Downey picked up the phone and called the California Architects Board , the state licensing authority .
" I said , ' Uh , I 've got a friend who 's an architect , and he 's licensed ; he lost his sight .
Can he , ah , keep his license ? ' "
Downey recalls .
" They were like , ' He 's passed his exam , he 's got his license ? ' "
Downey said yes . " They said , ' He 's got it for life .
As long as he pays his fees . '"
We think of architecture as a visual discipline , but vision is just one of our spatial senses .
Close your eyes , after all , and the room around you is still there .
When Downey lost his sight , his curiosity about the way environments are constructed did n't go away ; it simply shifted to his other senses .
When he could see , Downey often sketched as a way of sorting out architectural details he found puzzling .
Now he taps his cane to get a sense of the volume of the space he 's in , or he 'll touch a wall or a transition point in the building to figure out how it 's put together .
He does n't use a guide dog , because he would lose that intimate contact with the landscape .
" I 'm often trying to understand as much of the architectural space and form as I can , " he says .
The listening skills required practice , but the tactile ones did n't .
" As kids we learn through touch , before our visual system is fully developed , " he explains .
Downey 's years of cycling also gave him a feel for the modulations of the streets , down to the dips and crests of the roads around his <START:location> Piedmont <END> home .
Whenever people ask his wife for directions , Downey invariably answers .
[Jessie Lorenz and Phoenix . ]
When he 's pressed for time , or just trying to travel efficiently from place to place , Downey does n't bother with trying to create that mental model of his surroundings .
" I 'm just connecting points , " he says , " to find , ' This is the flow that works through here . '"
In those instances , he experiences space as essentially bland .
" You could think of it like a really monotonous environment that is sort of frustrating or confusing because everything 's the same , " he says .
" Like a convention center or airport . "
( One exception : <START:location> Chicago O'Hare <END> , Downey 's favorite airport , because the concourse 's terrazzo floors and vaulted glass skylight bounce sound in a legible way , leaving a kind of sonic breadcrumb trail . )
For the most part , places that tend to be dull for the sighted world also do little for people who ca n't see : think low , undifferentiated ceilings and vast swaths of carpet tile .
Carpet dampens sound , and the unchanging ceiling , when sounds bounce off it , gives no indication of which direction is which .
Think of being trapped in the world 's largest DMV .
After he lost his sight , Downey found that buildings he appreciated in his prior life offered him new multisensory riches .
When he visited Louis Kahn 's Kimbell Art Museum in <START:location> Fort Worth , Texas <END> , he was surprised to find that he could intuit the layout of the galleries through the floor texture .
Bands of travertine trace the path of the structural grid , interspersed with intervals of wood .
" Having those bands begins to modulate the space , " he says .
" Kahn would 've done that for a visual modulation , " but the architect might have been thinking texturally as well .
" I 've since learned that he was getting pretty blind by the time he did that building , " says Downey .
" He almost had to have his face right on the drawings to be able to see them . "
Downey remained at the modular-housing firm through the end of 2008 .
The recession had deepened , and banks had all but quit underwriting loans in the niche market of unconventional prefab homes .
Downey survived several rounds of cuts that fall , but just before the holidays , he was laid off .
With the building industry at a near standstill , prospects were grim even for architects who could see .
In early 2009 , Downey got in touch with a business adviser , who connected him with the <START:location> Oakland <END> firm Design Partnership .
As it happened , that firm was collaborating with SmithGroup on a new polytrauma and blind rehabilitation center for the <START:location> Palo Alto <END> veterans ' hospital .
SmithGroup hired him to consult on the project .
Far from being unemployable , Downey found himself in possession of a rare combination of skills .
Here were two groups that had little in common : blind people and the hypervisual architects who design spaces .
In the Venn diagram linking them , Downey was a set of one .
( In the US , at least .
In <START:location> Portugal <END> , the architect Carlos Mourão Pereira has maintained a practice since losing his sight in 2006 .
The two met in 2009 in a <START:location> New York <END> Starbucks , in what they dubbed the first-ever International Blind Architects Conference . )
Since landing that initial consulting job on the veterans ' rehabilitation center , Downey has carved out a niche helping a visual industry locate its blind spots .
His portfolio has swelled with health-care projects , including the Duke Eye Center in <START:location> Durham <END> , North Carolina , and transportation work has picked up , too .
In 2012 Pelli Clarke Pelli , the architect working on <START:location> San Francisco <END> 's 1.5-million-square-foot Transbay Transit Center , asked Downey to help chart a legible path for visually impaired passengers along what will be a four-block-long bus depot .
Downey 's copy of the floor plan , which he printed on his embossing printer , measures more than 16 feet long .
The Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) includes requirements for the visually impaired , not all of them attentively enforced .
Measures like braille signage and tactile paving ( those bumpy strips that signal a transition from sidewalk to street ) are universal .
But Downey has found that design teams often overlook rules governing protruding objects like diagonal braces or wall sconces , which are too high to detect with a cane but not high enough to ensure that no one will walk into them .
" A lot of architects I 've talked with , it 's not willful —they do n't know it 's an issue , " says Downey .
" You can see when somebody ca n't roll up stairs or reach from a wheelchair to get something .
" It 's hard to visualize what it 's like to see from behind somebody else 's eyes . "
Even when followed to the letter , the ADA rules do n't address how someone with poor eyesight experiences a place .
Without sight , curving paths are particularly vexing , especially if the path is texturally identical to everything around it .
" You have to have something tactile to work around that curvature , " says Downey .
" How do you know what the radius is ?
Even if you knew , how would you calibrate that into your mind to walk the radius ? "
For the same reason , round furniture is problematic ; there 's no way to walk away and know for certain where you 're going .
Downey recently toured a blind rehab center in Southern California where all the reception desks are round .
To give patients a way to orient themselves , the center added rubber tabs under the countertops to line up with particular corridors—the equivalent of a sign hidden under a table .
For more than a decade , the ILRC has been tucked away on the third floor of a brick mid-rise on <START:location> Mission Street <END> .
When the elevator breaks—which is often—the ILRC employees who use wheelchairs ca n't go to work , and would-be visitors in wheelchairs are out of luck .
" We have a youth group that meets on Wednesdays after hours , " says Lorenz .
" There 'll be , like , 10 minors in there , being young and crazy and having fun , and I 'm sitting in this office deep-breathing , thinking , ' Oh my gosh , if that elevator breaks and these kids are up here . '"
Two years ago Lorenz visited the ground-floor space on <START:location> Howard Street <END> , and she 's been fundraising for the move ever since .
Beyond the obvious boon to safety , having a street presence will raise the center 's profile .
" Our work is about keeping people who have a disability involved , engaged , and employed , " says Lorenz .
Joining the public realm is an important part of that .
" We need a place where we can be an actual community center . "
When Lorenz issued a call for architects in January , she needed to move quickly .
The center had to open in its new space in six months , and she had parted ways with the initial architect .
Downey had just wrapped up a semester guest-lecturing at Berkeley 's School of Architecture , where he teaches an introductory class on the ADA and universal design .
He was consulting on some transportation projects , including the bus terminal at the <START:location> Transbay Transit Center <END> , and looking ahead to another year of piecework .
When he got an email from Lorenz inviting him to bid on her project , "it was out of the blue , " recalls Downey .
At first he assumed that she wanted him to bid as part of a team with another architect .
But as he examined the email more closely , he realized he was the only one on it .
" I was like , ' Wait a minute , '" he recalls , " 'it 's addressed to me ! ' "
As a consultant , Downey did n't have a full-services architecture firm behind him , and there was n't time to start one .
He called Ashdown , an old colleague at the <START:location> San Francisco <END> firm Holt Henshaw , where he had worked in the '90s .
For a few years in the 2000s , they ran a firm together , Ashdown Downey Architecture and Design .
They formed a team , with Downey as the lead architect .
Ashdown , the architect of record , would handle the construction documentation and sign off on the drawings .
Lorenz and her staff interviewed three teams .
" Chris and Dwight charmed everyone , " she says .
When Downey and Ashdown won the project , they inherited the prior architect 's floor plan .
The conference room and reception area sat side by side in the storefront ; in the back , an open office area was ringed by private offices .
That layout set the center up to profit from its location next to Moscone—they plan to rent out the conference room for meetings—but it also meant that most of the center 's daily activities would stay hidden from the street .
Passersby who happened to look in would see , most of the time , an empty conference room and a reception area staffed by one or two people .
Not much daylight would reach the workstations in the rear .
" I was really obsessed with finding a way to get light and views back into the office , " says Downey .
He 's sitting at a large table at the office space he rents on <START:location> Annie Alley <END> in downtown <START:location> San Francisco <END> .
When he works on his laptop , he keeps one earbud in to listen to his computer 's audible interface .
The interface works with anything text-based—email , word processing , PowerPoint—but it ca n't help him draw in CAD programs .
Downey needed something tactile to work with , and he found it in a kids ' toy .
Spread out before him on the table are stacks of embossed plans like the one in Lorenz 's office , but these are marked up with brightly colored wax sticks .
Straight out of the box , the sticks are long and thin , like rigid threads of licorice .
Downey had run across them in his former life , when a waitress handed a packet to his son in lieu of crayons .
But he only learned of their application as a drawing tool in 2009 , the year after he lost his sight .
That summer he served as a mentor for blind high schoolers in an introductory architecture course put on by the National Federation of the Blind .
Architecture professors from the University of Maryland , College Park , had the students applying wax sticks to paper to create drawings and three-dimensional forms .
The sticks warm to the touch and bend easily ; they can make precise angles , and—crucially for Downey—their tackiness makes them stick to paper .
" Once I realized that , I thought , ' Oh , I could use that to draw on top of an embossed drawing . '"
Suddenly , he had a way not just to read , but to make .
Downey uses the wax sticks as an informal tool for sketching on top of working plans .
Once he has something he wants to bring to Lorenz , he snaps a photo with his phone—the shot is always a guess , but often there 's someone on hand to frame it up —and emails it to Ashdown .
Ashdown edits the computer file , which Downey can then print with the embosser .
The drawing in front of him indicates the reception desk with a red and yellow chevron .
It also reflects the change Downey made to get light and views into the back of the ILRC office .
He rejiggered the floor plan so that the open office area in the rear backs straight up onto the conference room .
He added a big window between the two , and brought the sill low enough that people moving around the office in wheelchairs could see out—and also be seen from the street .
" To me it was important that you see people with disabilities working inside , " he says .
Lorenz and Downey found themselves in the ironic situation of making visual decisions that everyone but them would be able to see .
For Lorenz , who has been blind since birth , ceilings were hard to wrap her mind around .
" Honestly , if you 've never seen a ceiling , it 's not really something people go around describing to you , " she says .
Downey made Lorenz a tactile drawing to illustrate the different ceiling finishes and changing heights , which follow the logic of the office layout .
A low wood-slat ceiling at the entrance fans into the reception area at a rakish angle , offering a warm ( and higher-dollar ) flourish where it counts .
Then the ceiling lifts and opens up to the mechanical conduits—which are painted white—to make the most of the available volume .
In the back , the perimeter offices have drop ceilings , and the ceiling over the staff workstations is open .
Downey brought Lorenz samples of the wood slat ceiling to feel .
" I felt like a ceiling expert , " says Lorenz .
" Chris was able to break it down for me in a way that was really understandable .
I do n't want to make a decision that I do n't understand .
I 'm way too type A for that . "
On the last Saturday of July , the new Independent Living Resource Center opened its doors .
With yellow walls and polished concrete floors , it 's lighter and brighter than the old space .
( Downey recused himself from the color discussion , enlisting Rosa Downey to handle the color palette . )
The receptionist , who is blind , greets everyone who walks in , so that visitors who have visual impairments have an audible target to approach .
With an office of this size and floor plan—a very legible progression of boxes—Downey did n't need to build in the kinds of wayfinding cues , such as changes in the floor texture , that would be necessary in a larger building .
" Not that I 'd be so bold as to say no one will ever get confused in there , " Downey says , " but it 's a pretty straightforward floor plan , and where it 's not there 's somebody there to intercede . "
When Downey walks through the center , he conjures a mental image of the space he designed .
But compared with a crisp memory from his sighted days , the ILRC will always have the hazy edges of an approximation .
" I recognize it as my perception of the space , and it 's been confirmed by my experience feeling the space , but I do n't have that visual confirmation , " he says .
" It 's hard for me to put it together with the same degree of clarity and absoluteness with all the colors and things in my mind .
With it comes some degree of a question . "
For now , Downey 's ability to do his job rests on the whims of the adaptive technology industry .
The manufacturer of his embossing printer , ViewPlus , recently discontinued the product .
" I'll have to go on eBay and buy up all the printers I can find , " says Downey .
" There are n't too many of them out there . "
But the profession as a whole is acquiring new tools for visual accessibility .
In June , Downey flew to Minneapolis to join researchers working on rendering software that will simulate the effects of poor vision .
The project , called Designing Visually Accessible Spaces ( DEVA ) , aims to create a filter that would allow architects to " see " what their designs would look like from behind different sets of eyes .
With that kind of knowledge , design teams could evaluate lighting and color schemes for potential hazards .
The initiative , led by University of Minnesota psychology professor Gordon Legge , is in its early stages , but the team recently received a second round of funding from the National Institutes of Health .
DEVA could ultimately create a bridge between scientific research into visual impairment and the architects who can make use of that research in the real world , Downey says .
" It 's a tool where people who can make a difference could make a difference . "

In the hands of Canadian firm La SHED Architecture , a dreary , well-worn duplex in <START:location> Montreal <END> is now completely unrecognizable .
Gone are the odd wallpaper and aged furnishings : after a massive renovation last year , the 2,700-square-foot home is all about bright lighting , vibrant colors , and versatile spaces .
As Dwell notes , the architects only preserved the building 's "overall shape and footprint . "
Otherwise , the changes are drastic .
A new open-plan area for the kitchen and double-height living room has been opened up , with a home office hovering on the mezzanine above .
The kitchen has been recast in white lacquer and outfitted with stainless-steel countertops .
Standing out in the whole space is the intense orange-lacquer staircase right by the steel bookshelves .
Other transformations include the master bath , where a larger skylight showers the polished space with natural light , as well as the new patio carved out from the middle of the second floor .
Of course , with a budget of $ 400K , which is what was reported on the project page , this sort of extreme makeover is to be expected .
Here are some before-and-afters of the house 's kitchen , master bath , and rear .

Is this space "feminine " ?
How about "ladylike " ?
Photo via Design Sponge
Others have made the point before , but the ongoing use of the words "masculine " and "feminine " in design writing has us , the staff of Curbed National , feeling it needs to be stated again , as clearly as possible : the people who write about decor and design need to stop describing spaces with gendered terms .
It 's an easy fix .
Decor bloggers , shelter editors , design writers : do n't type the words "masculine " or "manly " or "feminine " or "ladylike " or "girly " when describing spaces .
Do n't use any other words that prescribe gender to furniture or interiors .
Let 's say two spaces were written up in a decor blog , and one was described as masculine , and the other feminine .
Which would have white walls ?
Which would have raw concrete floors ?
Which would remind you more of Pinterest ?
Which would have more heavy leather furniture ?
In which would the books be ordered by color , and what would that say about the person who organized them that way ?
Which would have more antlers and dark throws ?
If these have fairly easy answers , it 's because we 're in the realm of stereotype .
The uncharitable term for a writer who channels stereotypes without some measure of ironic distance is "hack . "
Curbed National writers have used these terms before .
Curbed National writers have stopped .

The use of the words "masculine " and "feminine " to describe spaces harks back to one of the very first lessons children learn in school ; what boys do and what girls do .
This is one of those parts of culture that it 's very good to train yourself out of , or be trained out of , or never learn in the first place .
Many people across the spectrum of gender and sexuality have complicated relationships with what society seems to expect from them .
It would be cool if these people could engage in the leisurely practice of reading about furniture or interiors without having some of the shallowest of those expectations foisted upon them .
It 's important to note that femininity , by and large , is considered an additive .
In interior design , it 's translated to fresh flowers , stemware , and bed skirts .
It is ephemeral where masculinity is formidable .
It is whimsical where masculinity is utilitarian .
It is antiqued where masculinity is modern .
Lace and chintz exist only in "feminine " spaces .
If spareness and raw architecture are "masculine , " then we 're essentially saying that traditionally "feminine " decorating is frivolous .
Suddenly those who associate themselves with femininity become a little less essential and a little less relevant .
And , in the end , maybe just a little less .
Who wants to live in a world where all of that is taken for granted ?
Some might , but why would we trust those people to advise us in matters of style ?
It 's laughable in an era where the most prominent proponent of pink in the world of industrial design is a man , and the most sought-after and vilified hero-architect in the world is a woman .
Gendered design writing is lazily offensive .
But more to the point , it 's offensively lazy .
We can do better .

Turns out it 's a bit tricky to translate the bohemian-modern design blog aesthetic ( that is natural , haphazard minimalism ) into holiday cheer .
Sometimes , in fact , the results are just downright chilling .

Location : <START:location> West Lake Hills , Texas <END> Price : $ 6,500,000 The Skinny : Architect Winn Wittman once called the 6,100-square-foot <START:location> Soaring Wings <END> house of <START:location> West Lake Hills , Texas <END> , the project that "literally almost killed me . "
While managing the four-year construction of the home , which wrapped up in 2007 , he fell off a rock wall and broke his back .
Wittman made a full recovery , and his work payed off pretty quickly , when the house sold just three months after completion .
" Our plan was to build our own home , " one of the buyers told Architectural Record , " but when I walked in this one I felt spiritually connected to it instantly .
The quality and the craftsmanship are so high , and so specific , it seemed absurd that it was a spec house . "
Located just a short drive from downtown <START:location> Austin <END> , the home is connected to the locale by 45,000 pounds of red iron and 17,000 pounds of locally quarried shellstone .
( Other materials include pink <START:location> Arizona <END> sandstone , ipe wood , hand-seamed copper panels , and a " special concrete mixed with orange slice candy and gummi bears . " )
A two-story glass-and-steel bridge connects the four-bedroom private volume to the public one , which contains living , dining , and entertaining spaces .
Listed for $ 6.5M , it also comes with a saltwater pool , a long list of energy-saving features , a wine cellar , and a 3,200 pound granite bath tub .
Also , according to the listing , part of Terrance Malick 's upcoming film Knight of Cups was shot inside .

The storm dropped an average of between an inch and 2 inches of rain throughout the day in the <START:location> Bay Area <END> and <START:location> Sacramento <END> regions before heading to <START:location> Southern California <END> overnight , the National Weather Service said .
The rain came down hard in the <START:location> San Francisco Bay Area <END> Monday morning , making for a treacherous commute .
A landslide closed both directions of a highway in <START:location> Fremont <END> .
At San Francisco International Airport , the Federal Aviation Administration reported arrival delays of almost two hours .
In <START:location> Butte County <END> , a 4-mile section of <START:location> Highway 162 <END> shut down after getting flooded by swollen creeks and drainage channels .
There is no estimated date to reopen due to continued rain , authorities said .
<START:location> Yosemite National Park <END> officials said the <START:location> Tioga <END> and <START:location> Glacier Point <END> Roads have closed for the season because of deep snow and icy conditions .
A series of storms in the last few weeks have left up to 2 feet of snow in the higher part of the park , including <START:location> Tuolumne Meadows <END> and <START:location> Glacier Point <END> .
Still , Monday 's storm and another weather system expected later in the week wo n't be nearly as powerful as the blast that dumped as much as 8 inches of rain in parts of Northern California last week and up to 6 feet of snow in the high elevations of the <START:location> Sierra Nevada <END> .
That storm caused widespread flooding and power outages , including in downtown <START:location> San Francisco <END> .
And while the storms help , much more rain is needed to pull the state out of its severe drought , forecasters say .
The <START:location> Sierra Nevada <END> is expected to receive a few inches of snow by Monday morning at elevations above about 5,000 feet , a height that includes most ski resorts , said Eric Kurth , a meteorologist in the weather service 's <START:location> Sacramento <END> office .
The second weather front is expected to dump yet more rain Wednesday in the <START:location> Bay Area <END> , forecaster Bob Benjamin said .
In <START:location> Southern California <END> , a cold front is expected to bring rain and mountain snow Tuesday and Wednesday .
Thursday will be dry , then showers will return Friday and Saturday , the weather service said .

Pakistani Taliban militants stormed an army-run school on Tuesday and killed at least 104 people , including 84 children , shooting some in the head , while hundreds of teachers and students were trapped inside the building , officials said .
Pakistani security forces mounted a rescue operation at the school in <START:location> Peshawar <END> , the capital of northeastern <START:location> Pakistan’s <END> <START:location> Khyber Pakhtunkhwa <END> province .
Chief executive Pervez Khattak said that 104 people were killed , including the 84 students , all of whom were believed to be younger than 14 .
Teachers and one member of the security forces were also reported killed .
More than 80 others were wounded , some critically , said hospital officials , who pleaded with the public for blood donations .
Eight to 10 gunmen wearing the uniforms of security forces entered the Army Public School and College school around 11 a.m. and broke into an auditorium where ninth and tenth grade students were listening to a lecture , Khattak said .
About three hours later , four to five gunmen remained holed up in the office of the school principal , Khattak told reporters outside Lady Reading Hospital , where many of the injured were being treated .
One attacker blew himself up whole two others were killed by security forces , he said .
A teacher said that he was conducting an exam at the college section when he heard a burst of gunfire .
A teenage student who was rescued by security forces said he saw a gunman of about 25 years old firing indiscriminately at students .
The student , who requested anonymity , said the number of dead and injured could be very high .
“One of my classmates was dead , ” he said .
“As the army personnel rescued us and ushered us out , I saw many injured too . ”
Some of the injured were taken to Combined Military Hospital 10 minutes away , while others were brought to Lady Reading Hospital .
“Many are in the operation theater are now in critical condition , undergoing treatment , ” said Ejaz Khan , a Lady Reading Hospital official .
A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was retaliation for the Pakistani military ’s months-long offensive in northeastern Pakistan’s tribal areas , which has killed an unknown number of militants .
The school , which teaches children from kindergarten through tenth grade , is attended mainly by children of army personnel .
A Taliban spokesman , Muhammad Khorsani , told <START:location> Pakistan’s <END> Express Tribune newspaper : “We will target every institution linked to the army unless they stop operations and the extrajudicial killing of our detainees , ” he said .
The Pakistani Taliban has carried out brazen attacks on civilians and against students before , but this was by far the biggest and deadliest operation it has ever launched against children .
“The news from <START:location> Pakistan <END> is deeply shocking , ” tweeted British Prime Minister David Cameron .
“It 's horrifying that children are being killed simply for going to school . ”

A terrorism expert has warned that social media could interfere with future operations like the one which brought the Martin Place siege in Sydney to an end overnight .
" It 's natural we have that curiosity to figure that out , but somebody sending a tweet saying ' I 've just seen a man in SWOT gear climb a ladder', the gunman could be hearing that in real time and making a response , " Professor Greg Barton told 7.30 .
" We have to be careful .
Maybe in this case it did n't have a consequence but there 'll be other cases in the future . "
At the height of the siege , NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn confirmed that social media was hampering their ability to control information .
" We are monitoring what 's happening on Facebook clearly , " she told reporters .
" We are monitoring what 's happening on Twitter and that is forming a part of our tactical response in how to handle this . "
But it is not just the media and a general public hungry for information that are using social media .
" Increasingly with modern terrorism we 're seeing an increased focus on getting publicity and modern media , particularly social media , " Professor Barton said .
" Islamic State ( IS) , the latest variation of Al Qaeda , is intensely interested in media and publicity and very , very good at getting it .
" And even when they 've inspired some rather pathetic character to do something that 's not particularly professional , what they 've achieved via this guy is getting the whole world to pay attention for a 24-hour cycle . "
The hostage taker , Man Haron Monis , was also using it to try and manipulate an outcome for his own ends , forcing one of the hostages , Marcia Mikhael , to post his demands on her Facebook page .
That post was at 5:29pm ( AEDT) , almost seven hours into the siege , and the posts continued through the evening .
Eventually Ms Mikhael 's niece pleaded for people to stop sharing her posts , warning they could put the hostages ' lives at risk .
" You really ca n't hermetically seal information flows off anymore , " Professor Barton said .
" That reality may well have undermined the good professional response from media .
" We 'll have to sort of do the analysis and try and figure it out ."
Among it all , a message of hope did emerge on Twitter – the hashtag #illridewithyou , Australians tweeting to encourage support and friendship for Muslims travelling on public transport by offering to ride with them .
More than 300,000 people have volunteered .

Seattle
WHEN David and Annette Wolf decided that their family was outgrowing its <START:location> Seattle <END> area home , they also decided that they did not need much help finding a new one .
They combed Internet listings of homes for sale until they spotted a four-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac with a three-car garage and 2.5 acres .
But the seller’s agent refused to show it to them .
Why would she turn away an eager buyer ?
Not because of the Wolfs ’ race , creed or color .
Instead , Mr. Wolf , a software engineering manager at the online directory InfoSpace , said he and his wife were shunned once the agent learned they used an online broker called Redfin .
Mr. Wolf said they turned to Redfin because it gives two-thirds of its sales commission ( which is usually 3 percent of the sale price ) to its customers .
“ I did n’t want to pay 3 percent for the opening of a door , ” he said .
But customers like Mr. Wolf — affluent and comfortable with the Internet — are a frightening prospect for real estate agents who , as a group , reap at least $ 60 billion a year in commission income .
Redfin and other innovators , including ZipRealty and BuySideInc.com , are using technology to reduce costs and to save time for their brokers .
Agents don’t find and recommend homes — customers do that on their own , using Internet listings — and that enables agents to charge less for the services they do provide , chiefly handling the paperwork and negotiations .
The Internet has radically changed the way consumers buy books and airline tickets , trade stock and learn news .
But the real estate industry has resisted change — and protected its commission structure — by controlling the information on its Multiple Listing Service database of properties for sale .
“You can find out more on the Internet about an eBay Beanie Baby than you can about a $ 1 million house , ” said Glenn Kelman , chief executive of Redfin , a licensed broker in <START:location> Washington State <END> and California .
The M.L.S. is the only place that contains nearly all the homes for sale in a community .
Only brokers can post there , but agents can also display selected information about a listing on their own Web sites and on Realtor.com , a site that works with the National Association of Realtors .
Traditional agents still firmly control the M.L.S. , which allows all participating brokers , including Redfin , to view almost every home for sale in a particular area , even those being offered through competitors ’ agencies .
But the typical 6 percent commission , paid out of the seller’s proceeds and split between the seller’s and buyer’s agents , is under attack because , as economists note , it does not serve consumers well .
Economists who have studied the current system say that it also does little for most agents — except for a few stars , whose impressive earnings give hope to the large majority of less-successful agents and thus encourage them to protect the status quo .
Rivals on the Internet say they do this by refusing to cooperate with buyers using Web-based brokers and by denying M.L.S. information to some online firms .
THEY have not , as yet , fought back by reducing their commissions .
And Paul B. Goodrich , the managing director of the Madrona Venture Group in <START:location> Seattle <END> , an investor in Redfin , says he thinks that they are unlikely ever to do so .
“It will be hard for the real estate industry to change the way it compensates its agents , ” he said .
“If Coldwell Banker announced it was paying 1 percent commission to its agents , there would be a mass exodus . ”
As it turned out , the Wolfs ’ offer was the highest of five bids made for the house they wanted , and they were able to buy it despite the balky broker .
( They toured the house with a friend who is an agent . )
They also received a $ 16,300 commission rebate from Redfin and became firm believers in online real estate brokers .
But as the couple’s story shows , people who want to use Web-based brokers often have to fight to do so .
Many are , and there are growing signs that they are succeeding .
BuySideInc.com , an online buyer’s broker in <START:location> Chicago <END> that offers a 75 percent commission rebate , said that at one point 12 percent of its customers reported that traditional agents had refused to show houses to them .
The rate is now down to about 6 percent , perhaps because of responses like this : One client who was denied a showing made an offer anyway that was contingent on getting a tour — a move intended to alert the seller to the refusing agent’s actions .
“I’d like to have been the fly on the wall for the conversation between that seller and his agent , ” said Joseph J. Fox , chief executive of BuySide and a founder of one of the earliest online stock brokerage firms , WebStreet .
“The amazing thing , ” he added , “is that the selling agent still got paid and made $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 .”
In many cities , real estate agents have tried to restrict access to M.L.S. information or to limit its use on the database .
Some have asked state legislatures to pass laws forcing brokers to offer certain levels of service , a move that Mr. Kelman sees as intended to squeeze out discount brokers .
“It’s a thousand tiny shackles on innovation , ” he said .

<START:location> HONG KONG <END> — At least one thing caught the eye of <START:location> China’s <END> Internet czar during his trip to the <START:location> United States <END> last week : a book written by and about the president of <START:location> China <END> on the desk of Mark Zuckerberg .
Mr. Zuckerberg , the chief executive of Facebook , pointed to the book , “ Xi Jinping : The Governance of China ” last week while giving a tour of the company ’s office to Lu Wei , the de facto head of Internet policy in <START:location> China <END> .
Mr. Lu laughed when he saw the book , an anthology of speeches and comments by President Xi .
He then asked to sit down at Mr. Zuckerberg’s desk to have a closer look , according to an account published on a Chinese state-run website .
The interaction was confirmed by a person close to the traveling group who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private .
Facebook is typically blocked in <START:location> China <END>  .
Mr. Lu , as <START:location> China’s <END> new Internet czar , holds the key for American Internet companies to the enormous Chinese market .
He is also the ambassador of an assertive new policy in which <START:location> China <END> claims the right to block websites , censor content and track users within its borders .
One photo taken of the Facebook visit and posted on a site associated with <START:location> China’s <END> State Council Information office shows Mr. Lu smiling as he looks down at the book .
Sporting a white cover with a painted image of Mr. Xi’s bust reminiscent of the famed portrait of Mao Zedong that hangs in <START:location> Tiananmen Square <END> , the text offered Mr. Lu, a longtime propagandist who rose through the ranks of <START:location> China’s <END> state-run Xinhua News Agency , an easy conversation piece .
The book runs to 515 pages in English .
With the exception of a generous number of photos depicting Mr. Xi throughout his life , it might make tough reading , even for Communist Party stalwarts .
Mr. Zuckerberg said he had bought the book for himself and co-workers to ensure that they “understood socialism with Chinese characteristics . ”
The book might give some Facebook users pause , since the text includes a speech by Mr. Xi in which he says <START:location> Beijing <END> should “use Internet communication rules to advocate things wholesome and positive , and disseminate and put into practice the core socialist values , ” and “should properly handle timing , extent and efficiency to make our cyberspace wholesome and clean . ”
He also says , “It is a long-term task to ensure that online public opinion is healthy and sound . ”
The visit to Facebook was part of a whirlwind tour in the <START:location> United States <END> for Mr. Lu , a trip that offered the contrast of coasts .
In <START:location> Washington <END> , Mr. Lu faced strong criticism from American officials over Chinese hacking attacks and skepticism about his vision for Internet governance .
On the <START:location> West Coast <END> , though , he received a warmer welcome from technology executives , including Jeff Bezos , chief executive of Amazon , and Timothy D. Cook , the head of Apple.
Mr. Lu’s trip was followed closely in the Chinese news media ; in one broadcast on the <START:location> Hong Kong <END> -based Phoenix Television , eBay’s chief executive , John Donahoe , was shown discussing how crucial Chinese merchants were to the company .
Responding to reports of Mr. Zuckerberg’s meeting and his reference to Mr. Xi’s book , Hu Jia , a Chinese activist , said on Monday in a Twitter post that Facebook was “ risking repeating the mistakes of Yahoo ” by becoming too close to the Chinese government .
In 2004 , the Chinese journalist Shi Tao was arrested by Chinese officials after Yahoo provided information about his account to the government .
The episode prompted Yahoo's co-founder , Jerry Yang , to apologize to Mr. Shi’s family .
Mr. Shi served a prison sentence from 2005 to 2013 .
Facebook did not respond to an email seeking comment on Mr. Lu’s visit to the company .
The Chinese Internet market is huge .
A recent report by the research company IDC projected that with more than 680 million people expected to be online in <START:location> China <END> next year , its market will account for 43 percent of worldwide growth in the technology sector .
That makes it an increasingly important place to be for American companies .
But strict barriers and regulations in <START:location> China <END>  keep many of them at arm’s length .
Linked In , the professional social network , has decided to censor some content on its Chinese site .
Apple has agreed to host some data within <START:location> China’s <END> borders , where Chinese officials could potentially gain access to it , and this year it put out a job advertisement for a head of law enforcement in the country .
The job posting read in part : “The role will be directly responsible for the management , handling and issuance of appropriate responses to requests from law enforcement authorities , public prosecutors and courts etc . throughout <START:location> China <END> . ”
During Mr. Lu’s visit in <START:location> Washington <END> , he met with members of the National Security Council , who criticized continuing hackings against American companies and <START:location> China’s <END> top-down , government-led approach to managing the Internet , according to a senior American administration official who spoke on the condition that he not be named because the meetings were confidential .
The disagreement between the United States and <START:location> China <END> on such critical issues may provide one answer to why Mr. Lu gave equal emphasis to the <START:location> East Coast <END> and <START:location> West Coast <END> on his trip to the <START:location> United States. <END>
Meeting with <START:location> United States <END> technology companies provided Mr. Lu with ample photo opportunities to show off back home .
It also demonstrated that he could easily find eager partners in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , even as officials in <START:location> Washington <END> seek to play hardball .

Although fears that technology will displace jobs are at least as old as the Luddites , there are signs that this time may really be different .
The technological breakthroughs of recent years — allowing machines to mimic the human mind — are enabling machines to do knowledge jobs and service jobs , in addition to factory and clerical work .
And over the same 15-year period that digital technology has inserted itself into nearly every aspect of life , the job market has fallen into a long malaise .
Even with the economy ’s recent improvement , the share of working-age adults who are working is substantially lower than a decade ago — and lower than any point in the 1990s .
Economists long argued that , just as buggy-makers gave way to car factories , technology would create as many jobs as it destroyed .
Now many are not so sure .
Lawrence H. Summers , the former Treasury secretary , recently said that he no longer believed that automation would always create new jobs .
“This is n’t some hypothetical future possibility , ” he said .
“This is something that ’s emerging before us right now . ”
Erik Brynjolfsson , an economist at M.I.T. , said , “This is the biggest challenge of our society for the next decade . ”
Mr. Brynjolfsson and other experts say they believe that society has a chance to meet the challenge in ways that will allow technology to be mostly a positive force .
In addition to making some jobs obsolete , new technologies have also long complemented people’s skills and enabled them to be more productive — as the Internet and word processing have for office workers or robotic surgery has for surgeons .
More productive workers , in turn , earn more money and produce goods and services that improve lives .
“It is literally the story of the economic development of the world over the last 200 years , ” said Marc Andreessen , a venture capitalist and an inventor of the web browser .
“ Just as most of us today have jobs that weren’t even invented 100 years ago , the same will be true 100 years from now . ”
Yet there is deep uncertainty about how the pattern will play out now , as two trends are interacting .
Artificial intelligence has become vastly more sophisticated in a short time , with machines now able to learn , not just follow programmed instructions , and to respond to human language and movement .
At the same time , the American work force has gained skills at a slower rate than in the past — and at a slower rate than in many other countries .
Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 are among the most skilled in the world , according to a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Younger Americans are closer to average among the residents of rich countries , and below average by some measures .
Clearly , many workers feel threatened by technology .
In a recent New York Times/CBS News/Kaiser Family Foundation poll of Americans between the ages of 25 and 54 who were not working , 37 percent of those who said they wanted a job said technology was a reason they did not have one .
Even more — 46 percent — cited “lack of education or skills necessary for the jobs available . ”
Self-driving vehicles are an example of the crosscurrents .
They could put truck and taxi drivers out of work — or they could enable drivers to be more productive during the time they used to spend driving , which could earn them more money .
But for the happier outcome to happen , the drivers would need the skills to do new types of jobs .
The challenge is evident for white-collar jobs , too .
Ad sales agents and pilots are two jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects will decline in number over the next decade .
Flying a plane is largely automated today and will become more so .
And at Google , the biggest seller of online ads , software does much of the selling and placing of search ads , meaning there is much less need for salespeople .
There are certain human skills machines will probably never replicate , like common sense , adaptability and creativity , said David Autor , an economist at M.I.T.
Even jobs that become automated often require human involvement , like doctors on standby to assist the automated anesthesiologist , called Sedasys .
Elsewhere , though , machines are replacing certain jobs .
Telemarketers are among those most at risk , according to a recent study by Oxford University professors .
They identified recreational therapists as the least endangered — and yet that judgment may prove premature .
Already , Microsoft’s Kinect can recognize a person’s movements and correct them while doing exercise or physical therapy .
Other fields could follow .
The inventors of facial recognition software from a University of California , San Diego lab say it can estimate pain levels from children’s expressions and screen people for depression .
Machines are even learning to taste : The <START:location> Thai <END> government in September introduced a robot that determines whether Thai food tastes sufficiently authentic or whether it needs another squirt of fish sauce .
Watson , the computer system built by IBM that beat humans at Jeopardy in 2011 , has since learned to do other human tasks .
This year , it began advising military veterans on complex life decisions like where to live and which insurance to buy . Watson culls through documents for scientists and lawyers and creates new recipes for chefs .
Now IBM is trying to teach Watson emotional intelligence .
IBM , like many tech companies , says Watson is assisting people , not replacing them , and enabling them to be more productive in new types of jobs .
It will be years before we know what happens to the counselors , salespeople , chefs , paralegals and researchers whose jobs Watson is learning to do .
Whether experts lean toward the more pessimistic view of new technology or the most optimistic one , many agree that the uncertainty is vast .
Not even the people who spend their days making and studying new technology say they understand the economic and societal effects of the new digital revolution .
When the University of Chicago asked a panel of leading economist s about automation , 76 percent agreed that it had not historically decreased employment .
But when asked about the more recent past , they were less sanguine .
About 33 percent said technology was a central reason that median wages had been stagnant over the past decade , 20 percent said it was not and 29 percent were unsure .
Perhaps the most worrisome development is how poorly the job market is already functioning for many workers .
More than 16 percent of men between the ages of 25 and 54 are not working , up from 5 percent in the late 1960s ; 30 percent of women in this age group are not working , up from 25 percent in the late 1990s .
For those who are working , wage growth has been weak , while corporate profits have surged .
“We’re going to enter a world in which there’s more wealth and less need to work , ” Mr. Brynjolfsson said .
“That should be good news .
But if we just put it on autopilot , there’s no guarantee this will work out .”
Some say the nature of work will need to change .
Google’s co-founder , Larry Page , recently suggested a four-day workweek , so as technology displaces jobs , more people can find employment .
Others believe the role of the public sector should expand , to help those struggling to find work .
Many point to education , in new technologies and in the skills that remain uniquely human , like creativity and judgment .
“The answer is surely not to try to stop technical change , ” Mr. Summers said , “but the answer is not to just suppose that everything’s going to be O.K. because the magic of the market will assure that ’s true . ”

There are two disciplines in which <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> entrepreneurs excel above almost everyone else .
The first is making exorbitant amounts of money .
The second is pretending they don’t care about that money .
To understand this , let’s enter into evidence Exhibit A: the annual Burning Man festival in <START:location> Black Rock City , Nev. <END>
If you have never been to Burning Man , your perception is likely this : a white-hot desert filled with 50,000 stoned , half-naked hippies doing sun salutations while techno music thumps through the air .
A few years ago , this assumption would have been mostly correct .
But now things are a little different .
Over the last two years , Burning Man , which this year runs from Aug. 25 to Sept. 1 , has been the annual getaway for a new crop of millionaire and billionaire technology moguls , many of whom are one-upping one another in a secret game of I-can-spend-more-money-than-you-can and , some say , ruining it for everyone else .
Some of the biggest names in technology have been making the pilgrimage to the desert for years , happily blending in unnoticed .
These include Larry Page and Sergey Brin , the Google founders , and Jeff Bezos , chief executive of Amazon .
But now a new set of younger rich techies are heading east , including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook , employees from Twitter , Zynga and Uber , and a slew of khaki-wearing venture capitalists .
Before I explain just how ridiculous the spending habits of these baby billionaires have become , let’s go over the rules of Burning Man : You bring your own place to sleep ( often a tent ) , food to eat ( often ramen noodles ) and the strangest clothing possible for the week ( often not much ) .
There is no Internet or cell reception .
While drugs are technically illegal , they are easier to find than candy on Halloween .
And as for money , with the exception of coffee and ice , you cannot buy anything at the festival .
Selling things to people is also a strict no-no .
Instead , Burners ( as they are called ) simply give things away .
What’s yours is mine .
And that often means everything from a meal to saliva .
In recent years , the competition for who in the tech world could outdo who evolved from a need for more luxurious sleeping quarters .
People went from spending the night in tents , to renting R.V.s , to building actual structures .
“We used to have R.V.s and precooked meals , ” said a man who attends Burning Man with a group of <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> entrepreneurs .
( He asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize those relationships . )
“Now , we have the craziest chefs in the world and people who build yurts for us that have beds and air-conditioning . ”
He added with a sense of amazement , “Yes , air-conditioning in the middle of the desert ! ”
His camp includes about 100 people from the <START:location> Valley <END> and <START:location> Hollywood <END> start-ups , as well as several venture capital firms .
And while dues for most non-tech camps run about $ 300 a person , he said his camp’s fees this year were $ 25,000 a person .
A few people , mostly female models flown in from <START:location> New York <END> , get to go free , but when all is told , the weekend accommodations will collectively cost the partygoers over $ 2 million .
This is drastically different from the way most people experience the event .
When I attended Burning Man a few years ago , we slept in tents and a U-Haul moving van .
We lived on cereal and beef jerky for a week .
And while Burning Man was one of the best experiences of my life , using the public Porta-Potty toilets was certainly one of the most revolting experiences thus far .
But that ’s what makes Burning Man so great : at least you’re all experiencing those gross toilets together .
That is , until recently .
Now the rich are spending thousands of dollars to get their own luxury restroom trailers , just like those used on movie sets .
“Anyone who has been going to Burning Man for the last five years is now seeing things on a level of expense or flash that did n’t exist before , ” said Brian Doherty , author of the book “ This Is Burning Man . ”
“It does have this feeling that , ‘ Oh , look , the rich people have moved into my neighborhood . ’
It’s gentrifying . ”
For those with even more money to squander , there are camps that come with “Sherpas , ” who are essentially paid help .
Tyler Hanson , who started going to Burning Man in 1995 , decided a couple of years ago to try working as a paid Sherpa at one of these luxury camps .
He described the experience this way : Lavish R.V.s are driven in and connected together to create a private forted area , ensuring that no outsiders can get in .
The rich are flown in on private planes , then picked up at the Burning Man airport , driven to their camp and served like kings and queens for a week .
( Their meals are prepared by teams of chefs , which can include sushi , lobster boils and steak tartare — yes , in the middle of 110-degree heat . )
“Your food , your drugs , your costumes are all handled for you , so all you have to do is show up , ” Mr. Hanson said .
“ In the camp where I was working , there were about 30 Sherpas for 12 attendees . ”
Mr. Hanson said he won’t be going back to Burning Man anytime soon .
The Sherpas , the money , the blockaded camps and the tech elite were too much for him .
“The tech start-ups now go to Burning Man and eat drugs in search of the next greatest app , ” he said .
“Burning Man is no longer a counterculture revolution .
It’s now become a mirror of society . ”
Strangely , the tech elite won’t disagree with Mr. Hanson about it being a reflection of society .
This year at the premiere of the HBO show “Silicon Valley , ” Elon Musk , an entrepreneur who was a founder of PayPal , complained that Mike Judge , the show’s creator , did n’t get the tech world because — wait for it — he had not attended the annual party in the desert .
“ I really feel like Mike Judge has never been to Burning Man , which is <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , ” Mr. Musk said to a Re/Code reporter , while using a number of expletives to describe the festival .
“If you have n’t been , you just don’t get it . ”
Non-tech Burners who have been may “get it ” but don’t like all this excess , and are starting to push back .
This month , the Key Group , a Swiss luxury concierge service , announced that it would be offering a Burning Man Concierge Service that seemed more like a cruise liner vacation than a week in the dusty desert .
( The company did not respond to a request for comment . )
Among the dozens of options offered by the Key , there is the “establishment of a camp with electricity , water and satellite Internet Wi-Fi connection , ” “cooks and fresh buffets for every meal” and — not a small task by any means given the distance from the real world — the “possibility of ordering goods and products from outside <START:location> Black Rock City <END> every day . ”
When the website Burners .me , which blogs about the festival , posted a link to the Key’s site , the Burning Man community seemed generally confused as to whether such extravagance was actually real or if someone was playing a joke .
When it turned out to be quite real , people railed against the service , and the Key removed the Burning Man concierge option from its site .
Of course , you won’t likely see pictures on Instagram or Facebook of the $ 2 million camps , chef-cooked meals , the Sherpa helpers and concierge services , or private and pristine toilets .
That would mean that the tech elite actually cared about money — which would just go against the entire Burning Man spirit .

This interview with Glenn Kelman , chief executive of Redfin , the online real estate site , was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant .
Q . What were some important early lessons for you ?
A. Two things influenced me the most .
I’m an identical twin , and I felt that with my twin brother , we sort of formed this unassailable force and it gave me the confidence to be different .
Even if I was a goofball , my twin brother was a goofball with me , so I did n’t have to worry about fitting in as much .
I was able to march to my own drummer .
My parents were a big influence , too .
My mother was a nurse , and my father was an engineer , but I just think they did n’t know how to fit in .
Here’s just one example : We moved into this ritzy neighborhood in suburban <START:location> Seattle <END> for a little while .
We were the only renters , and somebody came by to tell us that we had to mow the lawn , that there were these rules about how short the grass had to be .
My dad decided that he was n’t ever going to mow the lawn .
I just felt like we really did n’t fit in in a lot of different ways , and I was constantly in embarrassing situations because of things they did .
At one point , my dad used a machete to mow or really just hack back our lawn .
Eventually , I just decided that you could n’t die of shame and that I could do whatever I wanted to .
It made me less risk-averse , and gave me this confidence that I could be myself .
I think the corporate world is pretty starved for personality .
The reason you have comic strips like “Dilbert ” and sitcoms like “The Office ” is that people just can’t be genuine human beings in a corporate environment .
So if you can really be your own self , even if it ’s a little bit different , I think people are really drawn to that .
Q . Did you always want to go into business ?
A. I was sort of lost , because I wanted to study everything .
At different points , I applied to graduate school .
I got into medical school .
I thought about being a writer .
I thought about being an investment banker .
I just did n’t know what I wanted to do with myself .
I think the thing that best suits me about being a C.E.O. is that you get to exercise many different talents and wear many different hats .
Q .
So how did you get into the world of tech ?
A. When I was trying to write a novel , I ran out of money , and I was delivering packages on a bicycle .
And I finally connected with these guys who started a software company , and almost serendipitously fell into that .
I felt like they were goofy guys and that I was a goofy guy .
It was just a really interesting , harrowing environment .
Q . How so ?
A. I could hear them arguing in the conference room about whether I should be fired , and the C.E.O. would come out and tell me that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link , and God help you if you’re that link .
I went home every night just convinced that I was the worst employee they had ever seen .
It was a weird place , but it taught me to be tough , it taught me to be resourceful .
I loved that job .
Q .
You were one of the founders of Plumtree Software before you joined Redfin .
How did that happen ?
A. I met these V.C.’s and connected with Redfin , an early-stage company that had hit hard times .
It was three guys in an apartment who put listings on a Web site .
I was just the fourth guy in the apartment .
I loved it .
Q .
You now have 800 employees .
Tell me about your approach to leadership today .
A. The main anxiety I have as an executive is making the shift as a start-up person to becoming an executive at a larger company .
You worry that you need to change your behavior to match the new scale at the company , but you also worry that you don’t know what’s really going on , and that people are muttering , “Does Kelman have any idea how messed up this is ? ”
The way you find out is to have lunch with people , or go on a long car ride with them or join the running club with them .
But the most important thing you can do as an executive is to just ask the most basic question , which is , “ What should Redfin be doing better ? ”
People will say , “ I think it ’s great . ”
But if you say to them , “Think about it , ” and then follow up with them , you’ll hear , “ Well , actually , this is really screwed up , and I think you need to fix it . ”
Q . What else about your culture ?
A. The main project I have at Redfin is to unite two separate cultures — real estate agents and software engineers .
One of the ways we do it is by having people do “A Day in the Life ” talks during our all-hands meetings , and they talk for 10 minutes about a typical day .
Then you hear other people saying things like , “ I had no idea how hard it is to be a real estate agent . ”
Q . How do you hire ?
What are you looking for ?
What questions do you ask ?
A. Mostly what I’ve learned about it is , you can’t judge a book by its cover .
It’s very hard in an interview when someone talks about their work to judge them .
What you want is to have them do the work .
So when I interview engineers , I give them a coding problem and I ask them to work through it .
When I interview a marketing person , I say , “Write a press release , ” or , if you’re in P.R. , “Write a pitch . ”
I want to see the actual quality of their work .
The other thing that I look for is people who are beasts .
I was a dishwasher once and I kept falling behind with all the dishes , and this guy in the kitchen yelled at me to get me going — “You’re an animal .
You’re a beast . ”
And I was just a very intellectual , effete kid — I was probably reading Proust at that point in my life — and that experience made me a lot grittier and tougher .
If I have n’t found evidence that someone’s ever done anything hard in their lives , then I just don’t believe they’re suddenly going to be able to jump into a phone booth , come out wearing a cape and learn how to be tough on this job .
I want to know about anything you ’ve done that ’s hard , really hard .
So I tend to focus on that .

Loc Tran is a big man on campus at San Jose State University in <START:location> Northern California <END> .
“A lot of people stop me when I’m walking , ” said Mr. Tran , a 19-year-old sophomore , who speaks in quick and confident bursts .
“They congratulate me . ”
But Mr. Tran is not a star on the football team , or a leader in student government .
He is a top player on the school’s competitive video game team , helping San Jose State claw its way to victory in June over California State University , Fullerton , in a tournament watched online by nearly 90,000 people .
When the new school year started this fall , classmates ’ heads swiveled toward him when professors said his name during roll call .
“ I thought that was pretty cool , ” Mr. Tran said .
Video game competitions , also known as e-sports , have taken off on campuses across the country , including Harvard and Florida State University .
More than 10,000 students now play in the biggest college league , 4,400 more than last year and 4,600 more than the number of men who play on Division I college basketball teams .
The stakes keep climbing , too : Winning a big tournament can sometimes earn players several years ’ worth of tuition money .
And in a possible sign of the future , the athletic department of Robert Morris University Illinois in <START:location> Chicago <END> created an official video game team this fall , offering the same sort of scholarships given to athletes playing soccer , football and ice hockey .
While the college e-sports craze started as a grass-roots effort , game makers have quickly swooped in , propelling the sharp rise in interest .
The companies now underwrite scholarship prizes , offer team banners and provide organizational support , sensing a possible breeding ground for a new generation of superfans — people who not only play games but also consider them a spectator sport .
“Game developers are really waking up to the publicity power of these communities , ” said T. L. Taylor , an associate professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who has studied e-sports .
Colleges , meanwhile , are often standing at arm’s length .
While e-sports groups are often sanctioned clubs , receiving practice spaces from their schools , the leagues and competitions have few of the student regulations governing traditional college sports , like grade-point minimums or time limits on practicing .
The rise in e-sports has been so abrupt , many schools have not determined what to make of it .
Carter Henderson , a spokesman for the University of Washington’s athletics program , said no one from the department was familiar enough with e-sports to discuss the topic .
The National Collegiate Athletic Association , which oversees college athletics , said it had no comment about e-sports on campus .
Game companies say it is too early to predict how university administrations will become involved in e-sports .
“This is just how basketball was in the 1940s , ” said Christopher Wyatt , senior manager for North American publishing at Riot Games .
“A lot of the structure and organization you see in more formal athletics , that groundwork is still being laid down here . ”
But it is unclear whether becoming a more formal part of a school would help or harm the growth of college e-sports .
The time commitment required for serious competitive gaming could lead to concerns about whether e-sports leave enough time for academic study .
In addition , formal recognition could diminish the autonomy that companies and teams have on campuses , bringing about rules like Title IX , the gender equity law .
About the possibility of more official recognition , Dr. Taylor said , “ I don’t think collegiate e-sports players are unified in any way that this is a good thing . ”
For game developers , however , the lure of being on campus is simple .
“We think that ’s where a lot of our players are , ” said Michael Morhaime , the chief executive and co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment , which develops and publishes entertainment software .
In September , Blizzard flew eight finalists from the College of Staten Island , University of Massachusetts-Amherst and other colleges to <START:location> Seattle <END> to compete for $ 5,000 in scholarship money in a tournament of Hearthstone , a virtual card game from the company .
Last year , Azubu , a games media company , sponsored a competition that awarded $ 40,000 in prize money to six students on a StarCraft II team from the University of California , Berkeley .
Last February , Riot Games hosted its first North American Collegiate Championship , something like the Final Four for League of Legends , Riot’s popular online battle game .
A team of five students from the University of Washington won in front of a roaring audience at an e-sports studio that Riot operates in <START:location> Manhattan Beach , Calif. <END> , with 169,000 more people watching online at the tournament’s peak .
The prize was $ 7,500 in scholarship money for each team member .
Riot recently announced that first-place winnings at the next championship , to be held in the spring , would rise to $ 30,000 , enough to pay for about three years of in-state tuition at the University of Washington.
“A lot more people than I expected came forward and said , ‘I’d like to try out for the team , ’ ” said Jackson Brown , the manager of the University of Washington’s team , the Purple Caster Minions .
The growth of competitive gaming at colleges mirrors the broader rise of e-sports as entertainment .
A thriving international professional e-sports circuit routinely draws tens of thousands of spectators to stadiums for competitions , with millions more viewers online .
Top prizes for some events are now in the millions of dollars .
Twitch , a video streaming service that made its name broadcasting e-sport matches , was acquired this year for close to $ 1 billion by Amazon .
The college scene is largely organized around the Collegiate StarLeague , which started at Princeton in 2009 and is the biggest college league .
The organization is now active at 450 schools , up from 260 last year , according to Duran Parsi , the head of the league .
Many of those players also participate in matches organized by another collegiate league , IvyLoL .
Large <START:location> West Coast <END> schools like the University of Washington and University of British Columbia tend to dominate the competitions .
The money that game companies are pouring into the college scene has persuaded many students to become much more serious about e-sports .
College scholarships from corporations , including Coca-Cola, Ford and Google , have been around for decades , usually to encourage students to enter a particular field , like engineering .
The money that game companies are giving to students , in contrast , is meant to deepen the companies ’ relationship with a whole generation of players , one that is inseparable from their products .
Today , most professional players skip or delay college , because the college-age years are considered the prime period for players in the big leagues .
Playing at the professional level requires far too much time for practice and travel to tournaments to allow them to also attend school .
Conan Liu , a student at Berkeley , took a year off from school to play StarCraft II professionally after his school team won the Azubu championship .
Mr. Liu returned to school this fall to focus on pre-med studies because he did not perform as well as he had hoped in the pros .
While even bench warmers in the National Basketball Association make more than $ 500,000 a year , the same is not true of professional gamers .
“You have to really be at the top , top to make a nice living , ” Mr. Liu said .
Game companies and collegiate league organizers predict that college e-sports could become a pipeline for the growing professional circuit .
Game companies say they are awarding scholarship money at college tournaments , rather than unrestricted cash prizes , to give students an incentive to continue their studies .
“We really want e-sports to become as ingrained in the academic environment as anything else — speech competitions , football competitions , ” said Tyler Rosen , president of the e-Sports Association , which helps organize college events with the financial support of Blizzard Entertainment .
A test of what happens when schools embrace e-sports started recently at Robert Morris University Illinois .
The first 35 students to receive athletic scholarships under the school’s new e-sports program began training this fall in a room decked out with jet-black walls , mood lighting and leather gamer chairs with red piping .
The students , all League of Legends players , are getting up to 50 percent of the price of tuition and room and board , which runs about $ 39,000 a year , according to Kurt Melcher , the university’s associate athletic director .
Mr. Melcher said he had received more than half a dozen calls from athletic directors at other universities who are interested in incorporating e-sports into their programs .
The idea came to Mr. Melcher , a gamer , this year after he started reading about the Collegiate StarLeague .
A conversation with his wife dispelled any doubts he had about awarding athletic scholarships to gamers .
Mr. Melcher said his wife asked , “ Why should it only be given to some kid who can put a ball into a hole ? ”

<START:location> PARIS <END> — Europe wants to cash in on its tough data protection rules .
European Union policy makers are demanding greater controls over how companies like Google and Facebook use personal information .
At the same time , others would like to use those same laws to help European companies compete against their American rivals as a way to jump-start a sluggish economy .
That debate over how best to leverage the regulations was on show during a meeting here on Monday , as local privacy regulators gathered to discuss the growing public outcry over how governments and tech giants gather and use people’s data .
That outcry has resulted from disclosures by Edward J. Snowden , the former National Security Agency contractor , about the activities of the American and British intelligence services , as well as the expanding use of people’s information by Internet companies like Microsoft and Amazon .
‘‘ We feel we are losing control over our data , ’’ said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin , who heads the French data protection authority .
‘‘Data protection is at a crossroads , and it ’s important that Europe speaks with one voice .’’
Europe is now completing a new round of privacy rules , expected to be made final next year , that will give greater power to individuals over who has access to their data and how it is used .
European policy makers are also considering fines of up to 5 percent of a company ’s annual revenue , or $ 125 million , whichever is greater , when the strict privacy rules are breached .
While regulators are pressing ahead with even tougher data protection rules , some of Europe’s lawmakers are eager to allow homegrown companies to use the rules governing the growing amount of personal information online as a defense against the American tech giants that currently dominate the region’s Internet economy .
In <START:location> Germany <END> , for example , policy makers and tech companies have created made-in-Germany email and cloud services — which allow people to store information on the Internet instead of on their own hard drives — that comply with the country ’s tough data protection rules .
And companies in <START:location> Finland <END> and <START:location> France <END> are pushing their own rival services , which are based on <START:location> Europe’s <END> stricter privacy rules , in the hope of enticing users to switch from American Internet giants to local competitors .
‘‘ <START:location> Europe <END> must turn data protection into a competitive advantage , ’’ Manuel Valls , the French prime minister , said at the meeting here on Monday .
‘‘It’s difficult to accept that European citizens have their data siphoned off by other countries without their knowledge .’’
Critics warn , however , that <START:location> Europe <END> must also beef up its oversight of all technology companies as they are increasingly scraping individual data for commercial use .
Currently , each of the European Union’s 28 members has a separate data protection authority that oversees the activities of companies in its jurisdiction .
Campaigners say that these domestic regulators have yet to assess hefty fines on Internet companies for the potential abuse of people’s online data , and that the system must be revamped to keep up with how companies , either European or those from outside the union , are using online information .
‘‘The system we have now is n’t working , ’’ said Max Schrems , an Austrian lawyer who has brought a class-action lawsuit against Facebook that accuses the company of misusing personal data .
‘‘If you park in the wrong place , you get a parking ticket .
But if a company violates the privacy rights of millions of people , nothing happens .’’

<START:location> SALEM , N.H. <END> — John York , who owns a small printing business here , nearly fell out of his chair the other day when he opened his electric bill .
For October , he had paid $ 376 .
For November , with virtually no change in his volume of work and without having turned up the thermostat in his two-room shop , his bill came to $ 788 , a staggering increase of 110 percent .
“This is insane , ” he said , shaking his head .
“We can’t go on like this . ”
For months , utility companies across <START:location> New England <END> have been warning customers to expect sharp price increases , for which the companies blame the continuing shortage of pipeline capacity to bring natural gas to the region .
Now that the higher bills are starting to arrive , many stunned customers are finding the sticker shock much worse than they imagined .
Mr. York said he would have to reduce his hours , avoid hiring any new employees , cut other expenses and ultimately pass the cost on to his customers .
Like turning back the clocks and putting on snow tires , bracing for high energy bills has become an annual rite of the season in <START:location> New England <END> .
Because the region’s six states — <START:location> Connecticut <END> , <START:location> Maine <END> , <START:location> Massachusetts <END> , <START:location> New Hampshire <END> , <START:location> Rhode Island <END> and <START:location> Vermont <END> — have an integrated electrical grid , they all share the misery .
These latest increases are salt in the wound .
<START:location> New England <END> already pays the highest electricity rates of any region in the 48 contiguous states because it has no fossil fuels of its own and has to import all of its oil , gas and coal .
In September , residential customers in New England paid an average retail price of 17.67 cents per kilowatt-hour ; the national average was 12.94 cents .
Beyond that , the increases confound common sense , given that global oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in years , and natural gas is cheap and plentiful from the vast underground shale reserves in nearby <START:location> Pennsylvania <END> .
But the benefits are not being felt here .
<START:location> Connecticut’s <END> rate of 19.74 cents per kilowatt-hour for September was the highest in the continental <START:location> United States <END> and twice that of energy-rich states like <START:location> West Virginia <END> and <START:location> Louisiana <END> .
The lowest rate , 8.95 cents , was in <START:location> Washington State <END> , where the <START:location> Columbia River <END> is the nation’s largest producer of hydropower .
For the coming winter , National Grid , the largest utility in <START:location> Massachusetts <END> , expects prices to rise to 24.24 cents , a record high .
The average customer will pay $ 121.20 a month , a 37 percent increase from $ 88.25 last winter .
The utilities argue that they are hamstrung unless they can increase the pipeline capacity for natural gas , which powers more than half of <START:location> New England <END> .
That would not only lower costs for consumers , they say , but also create thousands of construction jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenue .
The region has five pipeline systems now .
Seven new projects have been proposed .
But several of them — including a major gas pipeline through western <START:location> Massachusetts <END> and southern <START:location> New Hampshire <END> , and a transmission line in <START:location> New Hampshire <END> carrying hydropower from <START:location> Quebec <END> — have stalled because of ferocious opposition .
The concerns go beyond fears about blighting the countryside and losing property to eminent domain .
Environmentalists say it makes no sense to perpetuate the region’s dependence on fossil fuels while it is trying to mitigate the effects of climate change , and many do not want to support the gas-extraction process known as hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , that has made the cheap gas from <START:location> Pennsylvania <END> available .
Consumers have been left in the middle , as baffled as they are angry .
Utilities across the region are holding workshops and town meetings to try to address their concerns and offer tips on energy conservation .
About 100 people showed up this month for a meeting at Salem High School here that included a presentation by Liberty Utilities , the largest natural gas distributor in <START:location> New Hampshire <END> .
John Shore , a company spokesman , told the audience that in times of peak demand , the available natural gas went first to residential and business customers .
Some power plants that normally rely on gas then turn to more expensive fuels like oil , although not all plants have the ability to switch fuels .
In some cases , electric generating plants go offline , and more expensive generators are used to make up the capacity .
Prices are also up this winter because they are based in part on last winter’s high prices .
Arctic blasts from the polar vortex drove up the cost of wholesale power in <START:location> New England <END> to $ 5.05 billion for the three months from December 2013 through February 2014 alone — almost the same as the cost for the entire year of 2012 .
Patricia Richardson , 78 , a <START:location> Salem <END> retiree in the audience , said she had already had an energy audit on her 100-year-old house , installed triple-pane thermal windows , bought a new boiler , had insulation blown in and put weather stripping around leaks .
She could not understand why her bill had still increased , even after pressing Mr. Shore .
Ms. Richardson said after the meeting that his explanation had been confusing .
“ I wanted to know in my heart that he was giving it to me square , ” she said .
“ But I did n’t get that feeling . ”
Many utilities provide rebates when customers buy high-efficiency appliances , and offer free energy audits , savings plans and guidance on limiting energy use .
Government programs and nonprofit organizations are stretching to help those who cannot pay the utility bills necessary to make it through this cold , dark season .
But even if these stopgap measures help some households in the short term , the outlook for the long term appears gloomy .
A year ago , the governors of the six <START:location> New England <END> states agreed to pursue a coordinated regional strategy , including more pipelines and at least one major transmission line for hydropower .
The plan called for electricity customers in all six states to subsidize the projects , on the theory that they would make up that money in lower utility bills .
But in August , the Massachusetts Legislature rejected the plan , saying in part that cheap energy would flood the market and thwart attempts to advance wind and solar projects .
That halted the whole effort .
“The impasse just kicks the can down the road , and I see no reason why this dynamic is n’t going to be repeated during the heating season for years to come , ” said John Howat , a senior policy analyst at the National Consumer Law Center , a Boston-based nonprofit advocacy group for low-income residents .
“ I think we need to be more aggressive in pursuing renewables and energy efficiency , ” Mr. Howat said .
“ But I doubt we can implement those solutions quickly enough and at a sufficient scale to relieve the economic burden in the short term on those 30 percent of households that don’t have sufficient income to pay these bills . ”
The problem may be getting worse , not only because of pipeline constraints but because old coal and oil power plants are being retired .
The Vermont Yankee nuclear plant , which supplies nearly one-third of <START:location> Vermont’s <END> electricity , is also scheduled to go offline this month .
ISO New England , the independent system operator that oversees the region’s energy market , said it expected there to be “sufficient resources ” this winter to meet demand .
But in a November assessment , it called the pipeline constraints severe and said the reliability of the system would “continue to be threatened ” until the region expanded its pipeline capacity or invested in other energy sources .
Figuring out how much new pipeline might be enough is not an easy calculation .
<START:location> Massachusetts <END> , for one , is analyzing its needs now for a report due at the end of the month .
It is a complex process , said Mark Sylvia , the state’s undersecretary for energy , because it must take into account the state’s desires to avoid dependence on one type of fuel , reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure reliability “so the lights stay on . ”

Google , like many tech companies , is a man’s world .
Started by a pair of men , its executive team is overwhelmingly male , and its work force is dominated by men .
Over all , seven out of 10 people who work at Google are male .
Men make up 83 percent of Google’s engineering employees and 79 percent of its managers .
In a report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last year , Google said that of its 36 executives and top-ranking managers , just three are women .
Google’s leaders say they are unhappy about the firm’s poor gender diversity , and about the severe underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics among its work force .
And so they are undertaking a long-term effort to improve these numbers , the centerpiece of which is a series of workshops aimed at making Google ’s culture more accepting of diversity .
There’s just one problem : The company has no solid evidence that the workshops , or many of its other efforts to improve diversity , are actually working .
In some ways Google’s plan to fix its diversity issues resembles many of its most ambitious product ideas , from self-driving cars to wiring the country for superfast Internet .
As in those efforts , it has set a high goal in this case : to fight deep-set cultural biases and an insidious frat-house attitude that pervades the tech business .
Tech luminaries make sexist comments so often that it has ceased to be news when they do .
Google is attacking the problem with its considerable resources and creativity .
But it does not have a timeline for when the company ’s work force might become representative of the population , or whether it will ever get there .
“ I think it ’s terrific that they’re doing this , ” said Freada Kapor Klein , an entrepreneur who has long studied workplace diversity , and who is the co-chairwoman of the Kapor Center for Social Impact .
“ But it ’s going to be important that Google not just give a lecture about the science , but that there be active strategies on how to mitigate bias .
A one-shot intervention against a lifetime of biased messages is unlikely to be successful . ”
Google says its plan is n’t one-shot .
It points out that it has been trying to improve its diversity for years by sponsoring programs to increase the number of women and minorities who go into tech , and meticulously studying the way it hires people in an effort to reduce bias .
In May after pressure from civil rights leaders , the company published a report documenting the sex and race of its employees “to be candid about the issues , ” Laszlo Bock , Google’s executive in charge of human resources , wrote at the time .
Google’s disclosure prompted a wave of similar reports across the industry , with Facebook , Apple , Yahoo and other tech giants issuing similarly dismal numbers about their work forces .
Google’s diversity training workshops , which began last year and which more than half of Google ’s nearly 49,000 employees have attended , are based on an emerging field of research in social psychology known as unconscious bias .
These are the hidden , reflexive preferences that shape most people’s worldviews , and that can profoundly affect how welcoming and open a workplace is to different people and ideas .
Google’s interest in hidden biases was sparked in 2012 , when Mr. Bock read an article in The New York Times about a study that showed systematic discrimination against female applicants for scientific jobs in academia .
The effect was so pervasive that researchers theorized the discrimination must be governed by unconscious cultural biases rather than overt sexism .
Mr. Bock wondered how such unconscious biases were playing out at Google .
“This is a pretty genteel environment , and you don’t usually see outright manifestations of bias , ” he said .
“Occasionally you’ll have some idiot do something stupid and hurtful , and I like to fire those people . ”
But Mr. Bock suspected that the more pernicious bias was most likely pervasive and hidden , a deep-set part of the culture rather than the work of a few loudmouth sexists .
Improving diversity was n’t just a feel-good goal for Google .
Citing research that shows diverse teams can be more creative than homogeneous ones , Mr. Bock argued that a diverse work force could be good for Google’s business .
Could Google investigate how biases were affecting people’s work — and , more important , could it change its own culture ?
Google’s human resources group , which goes by the name People Operations , functions like a graduate school research lab , with staff scientists who are constantly analyzing the company ’s internal operations .
Mr. Bock asked one of these researchers , Brian Welle , to begin a project on hidden biases .
After a few months , Dr. Welle came up with a 90-minute lecture targeted specifically at a skeptical , scientifically minded Google employee .
The lecture begins with a dismal fact : Everyone is a little bit racist or sexist .
If you think you’re immune , take the Implicit Association Test , which empirically measures people’s biases .
Dr. Welle goes on to explain that some of the most damaging bias is unconscious ; people do the worst stuff without meaning to , or even recognizing that they’re being influenced by their preferences .
The effect of bias is powerful , and it is n’t softened by <START:location> Silicon Valley’s <END> supposedly meritocratic culture .
In the lecture , Dr. Welle shows a computer simulation of how a systematic 1 percent bias against women in performance evaluation scores can trickle up through the ranks , leading to a severe underrepresentation of women in management .
Finally , Dr. Welle points to research showing that we aren’t slaves to our hidden biases .
The more we make ourselves aware of the role our unconscious plays in our decision-making , and the more we try to force others to confront their biases , the greater the chance we have of overcoming our hidden preferences .
Google offered several anecdotes that seem to indicate a less biased culture as a result of the training .
Not long ago the company opened a new building , and someone spotted the fact that all the conference rooms were named after male scientists ; in the past , that might have gone unmentioned , but this time the names were changed .
During one recent promotion meeting in which a group of male managers were deciding the fate of a female engineer , a senior manager who had been through the bias training cautioned his colleagues to remember that they were all men — and thus might not be able to fully appreciate the different roles women perform in engineering groups .
“ Just raising the awareness was enough for people to think about it , ” Mr. Bock said .
The woman was promoted .
Another time , in an all-company presentation , an interviewer asked a male and female manager who had recently begun sharing an office , “ Which one of you does the dishes ? ”
The strange , sexist undertone of the question was immediately seized upon by a senior executive in the crowd , who yelled , “ Unconscious bias ! ”
Mr. Bock saw all of these actions as evidence that the training was working .
“Suddenly you go from being completely oblivious to going , ‘Oh my god , it ’s everywhere , ’ ” he said .
But whether that will lead to a long-term change at Google and , in turn , the rest of the tech industry , remains an open question .

<START:location> MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif <END> .
— LAST June , in an interview with Adam Bryant of The Times , Laszlo Bock , the senior vice president of people operations for Google — i .e . , the guy in charge of hiring for one of the world’s most successful companies — noted that Google had determined that “G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring , and test scores are worthless .
... We found that they don’t predict anything . ”
He also noted that the “proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased over time ” — now as high as 14 percent on some teams .
At a time when many people are asking , “How’s my kid gonna get a job ? ”
I thought it would be useful to visit Google and hear how Bock would answer .
Don’t get him wrong , Bock begins , “Good grades certainly don’t hurt . ”
Many jobs at Google require math , computing and coding skills , so if your good grades truly reflect skills in those areas that you can apply , it would be an advantage .
But Google has its eyes on much more .
“There are five hiring attributes we have across the company , ” explained Bock .
“If it ’s a technical role , we assess your coding ability , and half the roles in the company are technical roles .
For every job , though , the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability , and it ’s not I.Q .
It’s learning ability .
It’s the ability to process on the fly .
It’s the ability to pull together disparate bits of information .
We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they’re predictive . ”
The second , he added , “is leadership — in particular emergent leadership as opposed to traditional leadership .
Traditional leadership is , were you president of the chess club ?
Were you vice president of sales ?
How quickly did you get there ?
We don’t care .
What we care about is , when faced with a problem and you’re a member of a team , do you , at the appropriate time , step in and lead .
And just as critically , do you step back and stop leading , do you let someone else ?
Because what’s critical to be an effective leader in this environment is you have to be willing to relinquish power . ”
What else ? Humility and ownership .
“It’s feeling the sense of responsibility , the sense of ownership , to step in , ” he said , to try to solve any problem — and the humility to step back and embrace the better ideas of others .
“Your end goal , ” explained Bock , “is what can we do together to problem-solve .
I’ve contributed my piece , and then I step back . ”
And it is not just humility in creating space for others to contribute , says Bock , it ’s “intellectual humility .
Without humility , you are unable to learn . ”
It is why research shows that many graduates from hotshot business schools plateau .
“Successful bright people rarely experience failure , and so they don’t learn how to learn from that failure , ” said Bock .
“They , instead , commit the fundamental attribution error , which is if something good happens , it ’s because I’m a genius .
If something bad happens , it ’s because someone’s an idiot or I did n’t get the resources or the market moved .
... What we’ve seen is that the people who are the most successful here , who we want to hire , will have a fierce position .
They’ll argue like hell .
They’ll be zealots about their point of view .
But then you say , ‘here’s a new fact , ’ and they’ll go , ‘ Oh , well , that changes things ; you’re right . ’
” You need a big ego and small ego in the same person at the same time .
The least important attribute they look for is “expertise . ”
Said Bock : “If you take somebody who has high cognitive ability , is innately curious , willing to learn and has emergent leadership skills , and you hire them as an H.R. person or finance person , and they have no content knowledge , and you compare them with someone who’s been doing just one thing and is a world expert , the expert will go : ‘I’ve seen this 100 times before ; here ’s what you do . ’ ” Most of the time the nonexpert will come up with the same answer , added Bock , “because most of the time it ’s not that hard . ”
Sure , once in a while they will mess it up , he said , but once in a while they’ll also come up with an answer that is totally new .
And there is huge value in that .
To sum up Bock’s approach to hiring : Talent can come in so many different forms and be built in so many nontraditional ways today , hiring officers have to be alive to every one — besides brand-name colleges .
Because “when you look at people who don’t go to school and make their way in the world , those are exceptional human beings .
And we should do everything we can to find those people . ”
Too many colleges , he added , “don’t deliver on what they promise .
You generate a ton of debt , you don’t learn the most useful things for your life .
It’s [just ] an extended adolescence . ”
Google attracts so much talent it can afford to look beyond traditional metrics , like G.P.A.
For most young people , though , going to college and doing well is still the best way to master the tools needed for many careers .
But Bock is saying something important to them , too : Beware .
Your degree is not a proxy for your ability to do any job .
The world only cares about — and pays off on — what you can do with what you know ( and it does n’t care how you learned it ) .
And in an age when innovation is increasingly a group endeavor , it also cares about a lot of soft skills — leadership , humility , collaboration , adaptability and loving to learn and re-learn .
This will be true no matter where you go to work .

Once upon a time , a new technology happened along .
It was called radio .
Soon enough , some people began plucking wireless transmissions out of the air for their own purposes .
One clever young man in <START:location> Washington <END> figured out how to intercept messages that Navy units sent to one another .
“ He has represented himself to be at distant naval stations or at sea on warships equipped with wireless apparatus , ” a magazine called Electrical World reported in 1907 .
Back then , this fellow’s actions were not unlawful .
They amounted nonetheless to a form of piracy .
As radio grew more sophisticated , so did those intent on beating the system .
In 1960s <START:location> Britain <END> , radio pirates flourished on unlicensed stations that broadcast from ships anchored beyond territorial limits .
They found eager audiences in young people who tuned in for the latest from the Rolling Stones , the Kinks and the Who .
( Talkin’ ′bout my generation . )
Then the world went digital .
Naturally , pirates tagged along .
One of them , the online sharing service Napster , forms the core of this Retro Report offering , the final installment in the current series of video documentaries examining the consequences of major news stories from the past .
Napster did not last long , two years .
But for a while at the dawn of this century it claimed to have 70 million registered users .
It spawned a host of Internet music-swapping providers , more than a few of them falling on the dubious side of the law .
Most important , it irrevocably altered not only the way in which Americans absorbed music but also their belief system in what they should pay .
The conviction theologically held by many boiled down to a single word : nothing .
“You have a generation of people now who expect their music for free , ” Greg Hammer , managing director of Red Bull Records , a branch of the energy-drink company , told Retro Report .
“It’s very difficult to change . ”
The music industry is not alone in coming to terms with altered realities .
As every sentient soul surely knows by now , the “culture of free” — words borrowed from the title of this week’s video — has turned the print world upside down , pushing newspapers , magazines and book publishers into a frantic search for financial safe harbors .
With the advent of broad Internet use in the 1990s came a notion that information should be free .
Never mind that the gathering and transmission of information can be a costly proposition and that ( dirty word alert ) money is needed if the survival of , say , a newspaper is to be ensured .
As with music in Mr. Hammer’s observation , a generation now believes that the written word , whether on processed wood or in pixels , should come without charge .
Napster burst forth in June 1999 , the brainchild of an entrepreneurial , 18-year-old computer wiz , Shawn Fanning .
His creation enabled anyone with a modicum of tech savvy to share audio files in MP3 format — peer to peer , as it was called .
Music lovers could download thousands upon thousands of songs , then pass them on to friends or create albums of their own on compact discs .
No one paid royalties .
To music companies and some individual artists , this was high-tech piracy and a threat to their fiscal well-being .
( It might be noted that the commercial introduction of CDs in the early 1980s delivered its own near-mortal blow to an earlier technology , long-playing vinyl records . )
The Recording Industry Association of America sued Napster for copyright infringement .
So did a few musicians , like the rapper Dr. Dre and the heavy metal band Metallica .
Not every performer thought of Napster as the enemy .
Some who might otherwise have been doomed to oblivion regarded the service as a platform from which they might find listeners and build a fan base .
Nor were all economists convinced that one free download equaled one less sale of a high-priced CD ; quite possibly , some of them said , people were plugging into music that they would never have paid for .
Napster , however , did not have the courts on its side .
Ordered by federal judges to stop allowing copyrighted material to be traded on its system , it shut down in July 2001 .
But from its ashes other file-sharing services arose , some bearing curious names like Grokster , Kazaa and Gnutella .
Mr. Fanning tried his hand at new digital media endeavors , including Snocap and Napster 2.0.
Few of those companies were unqualified successes .
One thing was certain , though : The culture of free was not going away .
A decade ago , Apple established a new order in the commercial music universe by introducing the iTunes store .
From its vast digital warehouse , customers could buy any song they wished , typically for 99 cents .
The arrangement was perhaps not ideal for the recording companies and for many performers .
Among other things , music albums — fixtures since the ’60s and , in many instances , creative masterpieces — were becoming relics ; single-song listening ruled , whether through an iTunes purchase or snatched from the ether via file-swapping networks .
Still , for the industry , some money was better than none , and so an iTunes reality beat a Napster world .
Now the music business is in transition once more , reshaped by streaming services like YouTube , Spotify and Pandora .
Instead of owning songs , a listener can in effect borrow them from millions of titles made available by these operations .
A cultural shift seems well underway , with more and more consumers sensing they no longer need to possess certain physical items , like CDs or books .
A reliable Internet connection will do .
Unlike Napster and the like , the streaming services are not engaged in piracy .
They are legally licensed , having paid music companies some money .
They themselves cash in by selling advertising or , increasingly , by offering subscriptions to customers interested in a commercial-free experience .
The results have been stark .
Data from Nielsen SoundScan , a sales-tracking system , show that consumers in this country listened to 70 billion songs via streaming services in the first half of 2014 , an increase of 42 percent from the same period a year earlier .
Sales of albums , whether on CDs or through digital downloads , declined by 15 percent .
Downloads of individual tracks were down by 13 percent .
Embrace the change , <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> types say .
But even if one does , it comes at a cost .
As CDs fade from the scene , so do stores like Tower Records .
Thousands of jobs are lost : workers who make the discs , wholesale buyers , salespeople , stockroom clerks , accountants and others .
Substitute work for them is not assured in the digital cosmos .
And , thus far , the people who create the music on which others build their fortunes often receive mere rivulets of reward .
Not everyone is a Beyoncé or a Taylor Swift ( who has removed her entire oeuvre from Spotify to keep it behind a pay wall ) .
Many more musicians are like Zoe Keating , a cellist from <START:location> Northern California <END> who described her situation in detail last year .
Over a six-month period , Ms. Keating’s songs had been played on Pandora more than 1.5 million times ; that earned her all of $ 1,652.74 .
She had 131,000 plays on Spotify in 2012 .
She took home $ 547.71 , or less than half a penny per play .
Some industry executives insist that , over time , things will sort themselves out , including how to steer more money to performers .
Last month , for instance , YouTube announced plans to generate revenue by giving its users an opportunity to pay a few dollars a month in return for extra features that are not available to those who click on songs at no charge .
Royalties to artists , in theory anyway , would thus rise .
In the meantime , some oldsters ( talkin’ ′bout my generation again ) may derive a measure of comfort from learning that vinyl albums still have life .
Nielsen SoundScan reported four million sales of vinyl LPs in the first half of this year , a 40 percent increase from the same period in 2013 .
Go figure .
Hey , maybe you can get a copy of “Revolution 9” from the Beatles ’ White Album , and check out for yourself if , when played backward on a turntable , it really does tell you that Paul is dead .

Until last year , when she became a planning consultant for a college in <START:location> Florida <END> , Alison Barlow traveled almost full time for an information technology company .
She was away as long as three weeks a month , making it home on weekends about half the time .
When a hotel stay at a Hampton Inn in suburban <START:location> Omaha <END> was punctuated by a bout of flu , the staff made drugstore runs and brought her tea and crackers .
Knowing she would return soon , she would leave a bag behind with toiletries , workout wear and extra clothes .
“You don’t want to check luggage on an airplane , ” she said .
While staying at a Candlewood Suites , she borrowed books and DVDs .
As hotels continue to add all manner of fees and executives look over their shoulders at Airbnb and the sharing economy , they are increasingly telling guests to pack light and borrow items from them .
While loan programs are an accepted feature at luxury and full-service hotels , experts say that those hotels are now expanding their offerings to include bicycles , automobiles and running gear .
And hotels on a lower tier , like Candlewood Suites , are starting their own programs .
“It’s reached all the way down from luxury to full-service hotels , and it ’s not unusual for select service , ” says Bjorn Hanson , professor at the Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University .
Some programs — like Kimpton Hotels ’ Forgot It ? We’ve Got It ! — have been available for a decade .
They are drawing renewed attention because younger travelers are responding to hotels ’ attempts to create a relationship by going out of their way for guests .
Bonnie Knutson , a professor at Michigan State University’s School of Hospitality Business , said she saw an emphasis on choice , personalization and customization .
“Guests are saying , ‘ I only want to pay for what I want to use , ' ” she said .
The Kimpton program offers a variety of small items and appliances , including chargers , hair dryers , extension cords and curling irons .
Hyatt Has It was introduced in February 2013 with similar offerings .
“Before , travelers thought we did n’t offer any product other than a toothbrush , ” says Kristine Rose , vice president for brand experience at Hyatt .
The program is aimed at the female traveler .
“Women tend to travel with a lot more things in their luggage , ” she said .
The program is offered under different names at all Hyatt brands .
In addition to lending books and DVDs , Candlewood Suites , an extended-stay division of the InterContinental Hotels Group , introduced a Lending Locker in 300 hotels in October 2013 .
The floor-to-ceiling enclosure provides items not typically found in guest rooms including fans , crockpots , dehumidifiers and office supplies .
Robert Radomski , vice president for brand management at I.H.G. 's extended-stay brands , which include Candlewood Suites , says the program creates a feeling of belonging for guests .
“It adds to their comfort , ” he said .
Some programs emphasize fitness .
Westin Hotels introduced a Westin-New Balance equipment-lending program at more than 200 hotels in November 2012 .
The company estimates 30,000 guests a year participate .
Peter Shankman , an entrepreneur and author of the coming book “Zombie Loyalists ” was one .
Fourteen months ago , at a Westin in <START:location> Atlanta <END> , he was up at 5 a.m. for a run before an early meeting .
After donning his shorts , he realized he forgot to pack running socks .
Expecting to run a 10-kilometer race three days later , he thought wearing dress socks for a seven-mile run that morning invited blisters .
The front desk staff offered him a free pair of running socks .
“They allowed me to continue on a schedule I preferred , which meant more to me than anything , ” he said .
Still , he has not traveled without his own equipment since .
A Westin hotel typically charges $ 5 per stay for the socks , freshly laundered workout wear in a variety of sizes for both sexes , and sneakers that are cleaned and disinfected after each use .
The inner soles are changed monthly .
Fitness appeal takes different forms .
In July 2013 , Kimpton , in partnership with Public , a <START:location> San Francisco <END> boutique bicycle and equipment company , introduced a fleet of Kimpton-branded bicycles that are free for guests to use .
Two to 10 bikes are available at 61 locations .
For guests who prefer four wheels , in March Loews introduced a chauffeur-driven car at five locations nationwide to take guests to nearby destinations .
Guests are responsible for their return transportation to the hotel .
At locations in <START:location> Miami <END> , <START:location> Hollywood <END> and <START:location> Santa Monica <END> , the hotels also offer free Fiat loaner cars .
Even as loan programs can create greater loyalty and perhaps a willingness to pay a premium for a specific hotel , they have potential drawbacks , according to one expert , who sees the possibility that fewer guests will request items in the future , because of concerns about health and well-being .
“Some hotels may temporarily suspend these items as a precautionary response to protecting guest health and reducing liability , ” Henry Harteveldt , an analyst at Atmosphere Research Group , wrote in an email .
For some guests , like Ms. Barlow , a preferred amenity is the ability to leave belongings behind .
Mike DeFrino , the chief operating officer at Kimpton Hotels , said he had noticed at locations in <START:location> Cambridge , Mass. <END> , and <START:location> Cupertino , Calif. <END> , as many as 5 percent of guests are leaving bags behind .
“At <START:location> Cupertino <END> , they leave suits , ” he said .
“They don’t want to travel with blazers . ”
By accepting guest property for safekeeping , hotels run the risk of losing reputation and loyalty if something happens to it .
“The worst thing is to lose or misplace a guest item , ” Mr. Hanson said .
Ms. Barlow said she drew the line at leaving a laptop .
Still , even as her travel has abated , she said she missed staying long enough to establish a rapport with the hotel staff .

<START:location> SEATTLE <END> – Last week , I had a few minutes to kill so rather than blow it on Facebook or Twitter , I made a little cash .
I installed an app called Spare5 on my iPhone and , moments later , was using it to describe women’s shoes for the Internet retailer Zulily .
After 12 minutes of tagging photos with words like “sandal” and “flats ” – and realizing how meager my insights into women’s footwear are – I prepared to see my earnings .
My payout : 26 cents or , if I had continued at that pace , $ 1.30 an hour .
Internet companies have figured out ways to help people make money by sharing their cars , renting out their apartments and performing mundane tasks like standing in line .
Now they want to give them a way monetize downtime , the brief interludes in most people’s day when they’re waiting for a latte at Starbucks , sitting in a waiting room or riding the bus home .
It’s the next logical step in the sharing economy .
The first generation of companies in the field – TaskRabbit , Lyft , Airbnb and Fiverr – turned people into microentrepreneurs , giving them online marketplaces to profit from their skills and property and , if they hustled enough , providing real income .
Spare5 turns them into something else – call them nanoentrepreneurs .
It is n’t a substitute for a job .
It’s a substitute for playing Candy Crush and liking pictures of your friends ’ schnauzer on Facebook .
Rather than spending a dollar to receive fake gold coins in a game , you can use the app to earn actual coins .
“We all have this Pavlovian response , if you’re in an elevator or have a few minutes , we all pull out our phones and do something , ” said Matt Bencke , the chief executive of Spare5 , which plans to announce on Monday that it has raised $ 3.25 million in funding from Madrona Venture Group , New Enterprise Associates and the Foundry Group .
The idea behind Spare5 , which was formed inside Madrona by a start-up studio at the firm , is to use that time more productively .
“You get a push notification , open it up and two minutes later , you made a buck , ” Mr. Bencke said .
“We’re very much trying to harness the attention deficit generation . ”
“We’re definitely not trying to be a job , ” he added .
Yet Spare5 is a form of work , even if it ’s not remunerative .
Mr. Bencke calls the app an “on-demand work platform that breaks large , corporate , operational problems into tiny , bite-sized tasks . ”
In its initial form , the company ’s corporate clients are harnessing the masses to help with a problem that has no great solution today : describing big libraries of photographs so that they are more easily discoverable to people through Internet search .
Having accurate , detailed tags on photographs – also known as metadata – is becoming increasingly important to e-commerce , helping people find the right piece of apparel , a home with the appropriate décor and a hotel room with the perfect view .
Having employees do the tagging is tough when a vast number of images is involved , and it ’s notoriously difficult for computers to accurately describe the contents of photos on their own .
Getty Images , the big creator and distributor of photographs , is starting a pilot program with Spare5 to help improve the quality of metadata on its photographs so that the most relevant images pop up first when its customers search for them .
Steve Heck , Getty’s chief technology officer , says the app can help with “disambiguation ” of existing metadata on photos ; clarifying , for example , whether a picture tagged “Chicago ” shows the musical , the city or the band .
The other option for companies like Getty is to farm out their image tagging to low-wage countries like India .
Mr. Heck said Getty had done that , but it was challenging to train outsourcers to do the work well and then retain their workers .
Getty has also considered using an online marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk , but he said the service did not give him much control over who was working on Getty’s tagging projects .
An appealing part of Spare5’s pitch , he said , is that it will use people who are qualified to do so to tag his images , based on their interests and expertise .
( Users of the app complete a questionnaire and provide links to their social media pages . )
About 12,000 people have downloaded the app , a quarter of whom actively use it , Spare5 said .
One of them is Courtney Dale , a designer at an architecture firm in <START:location> Metairie , La. <END> , who has made about $ 126 each of the last two weeks by using the app two to three hours a day , which qualifies her as an unusually industrious user of Spare5 .
“It does make you look at what you do when you’re just sitting around doing nothing , ” Ms. Dale , 25 , said .
“How did I feel comfortable just wasting time playing Angry Birds ? ”
There is something concerning , though , about the idea that unpaid spare time is time squandered .
Arun Sundararajan , a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business , says that services like Spare5 can be empowering to people who want more control over when and how they work , even if it ’s for peanuts .
But he says that can be taken too far .
“Spare time is a good thing to have , ” he said .
“You don’t want to spend every minute making money . ”

When you walk into a meeting , there’s always someone who thinks he or she is the smartest person in the room .
A meeting room is often the “Breakfast Club ” of the working world .
You’ve got the extrovert , the introvert , the know-it-all and the ambitious steamroller .
No matter what the mix , there’s always someone who dominates the discussion , and others who defer to that person out of frustration — or worse , complacency .
But getting the best work out of a team is n’t about silencing the loudest person .
It’s about getting everyone involved to explore every angle , bring all ideas to the surface and collaborate on a path forward .
Two years ago , I was asked to lead the transformation of product design at IBM .
My challenge is n’t simply to add designers .
It’s to create agile , multidisciplinary teams that include designers , developers and product managers .
Designing around the user experience , part of what’s known as “design thinking , ” has become crucial to the success of business software .
It’s not simply because people expect consumer-type experiences at work , but also because the information we receive and the speed with which we’re expected to deal with it have exploded in just a few years .
Work tools must be redesigned for this new complexity .
I’ve seen that team members are pretty good at organizing themselves when they have established relationships .
When people know one another and have developed empathy and trust , the issue of getting everyone’s ideas on the table does n’t come up much .
Over time you learn about each other , come to respect those who can contribute and just figure out how to work together .
I’ve seen this happen more often than not .
But when your organization is in the midst of transformation — whether it is a three-person start-up hiring a fourth employee or a big global company leading major shifts in technology — you are faced with teams of people who don’t necessarily have the shared experiences that enable them to behave well together .
Team dynamics can easily get in the way of good ideas , and the loudest voice often wins .
I used to lead start-ups and have found that the same basic meeting practices can be used no matter what the size of a company .
These strategies are effective with design thinking because they not only unleash everyone’s creativity but also give voice to every idea .
It has been my experience that the biggest impediment to getting people to think about what’s possible — instead of what’s not possible — is the difficulty in exposing everyone’s ideas to the broader team .
So we focus on two things : getting everyone to contribute and letting everyone’s contribution be heard .
That does n’t come naturally .
Sometimes organizational hierarchy might prevent a good idea from being considered because it was n’t shared .
So at IBM , we intentionally assemble teams that span skills , levels of experience and points of view .
And then ?
It starts with a sticky note and a pen .
We did this for our new business email tool , IBM Verse , which helps workers prioritize tasks and find the right people and information quickly .
We began not by declaring that we wanted to transform enterprise email , but by asking the team to think about what people dislike about email .
In cases like this , we begin by holding workshops where teams are given minimal instructions , and pen and paper .
After the team leader presents a challenge , the room goes silent .
Everyone spends 10 minutes writing their thoughts on sticky notes .
One idea per note .
No talking allowed .
Then , idea by idea , people post their sticky notes on a big whiteboard .
There’s still no talking , no judging yourself or others .
It’s total mindfulness about the user’s experience .
There’s no battling over the best ideas or who owns what .
Just get your thoughts out of your brain and on the wall .
The group keeps posting sticky notes until they slow to a dribble .
When the members are done , everyone steps back .
We call this popcorning .
You don’t want to give people too much time .
The point is to get everyone involved quickly .
Then , the team leader groups the sticky notes into overlapping and logical areas .
People take it all in , reflect , and then they disappear .
They are free to leave the room — or the building — to brainstorm with colleagues face to face , on the phone or via a group texting tool .
This opens up the playing field to less-vocal members of the team who are more apt to speak up online .
After this freestyle brainstorming , the group returns to the room , sometimes after minutes but it could be hours or even days .
Invariably they bring at least a couple dozen new ideas .
Those go up on the board .
Getting every idea in front of the team is important because it ’s very difficult to quash a good idea if it ’s shared .
Once you know something , you can’t unknow it — you have to act .
None of this is rocket science , but it ’s powerful if applied consistently .
It makes for better teams and it leads to better outcomes .
When you give voice to more people , the best ideas win , not the loudest ones .

Rising income inequality has set off fierce political and economic debates , but one important angle has n’t been explored adequately .
We need to ask whether market forces themselves might limit or reverse the trend .
Technology has contributed to the rise in inequality , but there are also some significant ways in which technology could reduce it .
For example , while computers have improved our lives in many ways , they have n’t yet done much to make health care and education cheaper .
Over the next few decades , however , that may well change : We can easily imagine medical diagnosis by online artificial intelligence , greater use of online competitive procurement for health care services , more transparency in pricing and thus more competition , and much cheaper online education for many students , to cite just a few possibilities .
In such a world , many wage gains would come from new and cheaper services , rather than from being able to cut a better deal with the boss at work .
It is a bit harder to see how information technology can lower housing costs , but perhaps the sharing economy can make it easier to live in much smaller spaces and rent needed items , rather than store them in a house or apartment .
That would enable lower-income people to live closer to higher-paying urban jobs and at lower cost .
Another set of future gains , especially for lesser-skilled workers , may come as computers become easier to handle for people with rudimentary skill .
Not everyone can work fruitfully with computers now .
There is a generation gap when it comes to manipulating electronic devices , and many relevant tasks require knowledge of programming or , more ambitiously , the entrepreneurial skill of creating a start-up .
That , in a nutshell , is how our dynamic sector has concentrated its gains among a relatively small number of employees , thus leading to more income inequality .
This particular type of inequality may very well change .
As the previous generation retires from the work force , many more people will have grown up with intimate knowledge of computers .
And over time , it may become easier to work with computers just by talking to them .
As computer-human interfaces become simpler and easier to manage , that may raise the relative return to less-skilled labor .
The future may also extend a growing category of employment , namely workers who team up with smart robots that require human assistance .
Perhaps a smart robot will perform some of the current functions of a factory worker , while the human companion will do what the robot cannot , such as deal with a system breakdown or call a supervisor .
Such jobs would require versatility and flexible reasoning , a bit like some of the old manufacturing jobs , but not necessarily a lot of high-powered technical training , again because of the greater ease of the human-computer interface .
That too could raise the returns to many relatively unskilled workers .
A more universal expertise with information technology also might reverse some of the income inequalities that stem from finance .
For instance , the returns from high-frequency trading were higher a few years ago , in part because few firms used it ; now many firms can trade at very high speeds .
It remains to be seen whether similar developments will lower hedge fund returns , but again it is possible to imagine a future in which many of the best investment and trading techniques are very widely copied and thus cease to be especially profitable .
A final set of forces to reverse growing inequality stem from the emerging economies , most of all <START:location> China <END> .
Perhaps we are living in a temporary intermediate period when <START:location> America <END> and many other developed nations bear a lot of the costs of Chinese economic development without yet getting many of the potential benefits .
For instance , <START:location> China <END> and other emerging nations are already rich enough to bid up commodity prices and large enough to drive down the wages of a lot of American middle-class workers , especially in manufacturing .
Yet while these emerging economies are keeping down the costs of manufactured goods for American consumers , they are not yet innovative enough to send us many fantastic new products , the way that the <START:location> United States <END> sends a stream of new products to British or French consumers , to their benefit .
That state of affairs will probably end .
Over the next few decades , we can expect <START:location> China <END> , <START:location> India <END> and other emerging nations to supply more innovations to the global economy , including to the <START:location> United States <END> .
This should n’t be a cause for alarm .
It will lead to many good things .
Since the emerging economies are relatively poor , many of these innovations may benefit relatively low-income Americans .
<START:location> India <END> has already pioneered techniques for cheap , high-quality heart surgery and other medical procedures , and over time such techniques may achieve a foothold in the <START:location> United States <END> .
Imagine a future <START:location> China <END> producing cheaper and safer cars , a cure for some kinds of cancer , and workable battery storage for solar energy .
Ordinary Americans could be much better off , and without having to work for those gains .
To be clear , these are speculations and should not be taken as reasons to avoid improving our economy right now ; furthermore , other trends may push in less positive directions .
Still , these possibilities reframe the inequality problem .
In the popular model developed by the economist Thomas Piketty , inequality is fundamentally about capital versus labor .
In his view , capital has opened up an ever-widening lead because of the relatively high rates of return on savings and investment .
The natural response to reverse this trend , according to Mr. Piketty , would be a direct attack on the return to capital , such as through a global wealth tax .
In the scenarios outlined here , though , growing inequality is highly contingent on particular technologies and the global conditions of the moment .
Movements toward greater inequality often set countervailing forces in motion , even if those forces take a long time to come to fruition .
From this perspective , rather than seeking to beat down capital , our attention should be directed to leaving open the future possibilities for innovation , change and dynamism .
Even if income inequality continues to increase in the short run , as I believe is likely , there exists a plausible and more distant future in which we are mostly much better off and more equal .
The history of technology suggests that new opportunities for better living and higher wages are being created , just not as quickly as we might like .

Cisco Systems on Friday filed a suit against Arista Networks , a networking switch company and fast-moving competitor , accusing it of copying large amounts of Cisco’s work .
Cisco contends that Arista violated 14 Cisco patents , some of which were based on work by Andreas Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, Arista’s founders , when they were at Cisco .
The two men , well-respected engineers , sold a company , Granite Systems , to Cisco in 1996 .
They are also both billionaires , thanks in part to being the first two significant outside investors in Google .
The case , filed in the Federal District Court in <START:location> Northern California <END> , will probably go on for at least months .
Cisco is seeking Arista to withdraw essentially all of its crucial products from the market .
Cisco is also likely to seek damages , said Mark Chandler , the company ’s general counsel .
“We are not a litigious company , ” said Mr. Chandler .
“This was so blatant . ”
Cisco was filing suit , he said , because otherwise competing companies might also try to make use of Cisco products .
“ I am disappointed at Cisco’s tactics , ” said Jayshree Ullal , Arista’s chief executive , in a statement .
Ms. Ullal , also a Cisco veteran .
added , “it’s not the Cisco I knew . ”
Though the two companies have in the past consulted over various matters , persons familiar with the suit said Arista was unaware Cisco was planning the action .
Besides technical patents , Cisco says that Arista’s command line interface , a way of operating its switch , includes more than 500 of the commands used in Cisco gear .
Arista did this , Cisco says , in order to easily win over Cisco customers .
The suit quotes Kenneth Duda , another founder of Arista , along with Ms. Ullal , saying in interviews how much Arista resembles Cisco .
“They said it is comfortable for customers ” to use the same commands , Mr. Chandler said .
“They did it intentionally . ”
Cisco also included as evidence grammatical errors in Cisco user manuals that were identical in Arista manuals .
More than a decade ago , Cisco used similar documentation in a copying suit against the Chinese networking gear maker , Huawei .
That suit was eventually settled .

Updated , 9:10 p.m. | <START:location> OAKLAND , Calif <END> .
— The lawyers fighting Apple in a class-action lawsuit involving iPods have managed to do a few remarkable things : They persuaded a judge to bring a decade-old lawsuit to trial here last week , for one .
They even managed to drag the famous Steve Jobs into giving a videotaped testimony shortly before he died three years ago .
But they have one big problem : Their case has no plaintiff .
A federal judge on Monday disqualified the only remaining plaintiff in the case , Marianna Rosen of <START:location> New Jersey <END> , after Apple’s lawyers successfully argued that she did not even buy any iPods for which she is seeking damages .
That argument also gave Apple an opening last week to ask Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers , the federal judge overseeing the case , to throw out the suit .
The judge , however , disagreed with Apple’s argument that it was too late to add a new plaintiff .
She ordered the plaintiff lawyers to find one by Tuesday morning .
The judge appeared annoyed about the discrepancies with Ms. Rosen’s iPods and scolded the plaintiff lawyers for failing to do their homework .
Another plaintiff in the case dropped out last week .
“You’ve certainly created a problem on the plaintiffs ’ side , ” Judge Gonzalez Rogers said before reaching her decision .
The lawsuit , filed a decade ago , involves older iPods , which played only songs sold in the iTunes Store , or those downloaded from CDs — not music from competing stores .
The plaintiff lawyers represent consumers who say Apple violated antitrust law because to keep their music , people had to stay with the iPod and buy higher-priced ones rather than cheaper , alternative music players .
For this , the plaintiff lawyers want Apple to pay consumers at least $ 350 million in damages .
The lawyers suing Apple were busy over the weekend , filing papers about Ms. Rosen’s standing as a witness .
Last week , Ms. Rosen testified that she had bought two iPods : an iPod Nano in the fall of 2007 and an iPod Touch in December 2008 .
Apple’s lawyer asked whether Ms. Rosen kept receipts for her purchases .
Ms. Rosen said she probably did not have the paper receipts , but later said her iPod Touch was in her bag .
Apple’s lawyers looked up the serial number of Ms. Rosen’s iPod Touch and found records showing it was bought in July 2009 .
The class action seeks damages for iPods bought from September 2006 to March 2009 .
So this iPod Touch missed the cutoff .
Apple’s lawyers last Wednesday pointed out the discrepancy about Ms. Rosen’s iPod Touch in a letter to the judge .
They also raised similar concerns about the second plaintiff’s iPod purchases .
On Friday , the second plaintiff dropped out of the case , leaving Ms. Rosen as the lone plaintiff .
Ms. Rosen’s lawyers then provided Apple a receipt showing two iPod purchases made in September 2008 .
But Apple pulled up its copy of the receipt for those iPods , which indicated they were bought by the Rosen Law Firm , the firm owned by Ms. Rosen’s husband .
Apple’s lawyers argued that these were not iPods bought directly by Ms. Rosen , and therefore she could not claim injury .
Over the weekend , Ms. Rosen’s lawyers filed a letter including a declaration by Ms. Rosen about the iPods .
In it , Ms. Rosen said that on Sept. 11 , 2008 , she bought an iPod Touch — not the same one that she brought to court .
She also said that on the same day , she bought the iPod Nano .
In her declaration , Ms. Rosen also said that she bought the iPods for her own use , not for her husband’s law firm .
But she said that she believed the credit card she used was issued in both her name and that of the family business , the Rosen Law Firm , and that she was authorized to make personal purchases with it .
In summary , Ms. Rosen amended her testimony , saying that she bought two iPods on the same day in September 2008 .
Despite that , the judge said late Monday that Ms. Rosen was inadequate to serve as a plaintiff .
Bonny Sweeney , the plaintiff’s lead attorney , told the judge that a number of people had approached her team over the weekend , asking to be considered as plaintiffs , and many had already been interviewed .
“Yes , we certainly have another plaintiff , ” she said .

<START:location> WASHINGTON <END> — The Kewaunee nuclear power plant in <START:location> Wisconsin <END> shut down for the last time on Tuesday , but it is preparing to break new ground for the American nuclear industry .
It may go to sleep , Snow White-style , for 50 years , to be awakened when its radioactivity has subsided .
Or it may be dismantled in the next decade or so .
In either case , the responsibility and the expense , probably near $ 1 billion , will be borne for the first time by a for-profit company , not a regulated utility .
The Kewaunee plant , which opened in 1974 , was sold in 2005 to Dominion , based in <START:location> Richmond , Va. <END> , by its owners , the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Wisconsin Power and Light .
In the past , the lengthy decommissioning process that nuclear power requires was in the hands of local companies , which have had the option to go to a public service commission and ask for a rate increase to pay for the job if it proved unexpectedly difficult .
But Kewaunee was a “merchant ” plant , a sort of free agent on the grid , selling its electricity on contract , at a price set by the market , not by the government .
Dominion says it has reserved enough money to do the job , and a big enough bank account if the reserve fund does not suffice .
So far , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission agrees , although a commission expert said the actual budget was open to question .
But “when you try to do any of these calculations beyond seven years , I’ll be frank with you , ” said Michael Dusaniwskyj , an economist with the commission .
“It’s a shot in the dark . ”
The variables for Kewaunee , which is about 35 miles southeast of <START:location> Green Bay <END> , include the amount it can win in a legal dispute with the Energy Department , which was supposed to start taking away the spent fuel more than a decade ago but will not begin doing so for many years to come .
Other factors are the scrap value of the tons of steel and copper in its equipment and structure , and the rate of return it can earn , above inflation , on the $ 578 million reserve Dominion has set aside .
Three <START:location> Wisconsin <END> state agencies said they had had no jurisdiction since the public service commission approved the sale of Kewaunee eight years ago .
That does not mean that no one is concerned .
“It’s a strange situation for sure , for <START:location> Wisconsin <END> , which has very little to do with a decision made by another entity , and it ’s going to be around for another 60 years , ” said Charles Higley , the director of the Citizens Utility Board , a nonprofit agency that seeks to represent residential consumers , farmers and small businesses before the public service commission .
But the chief nuclear officer of Dominion , David A. Heacock , said his company projected that the money on hand would be enough , even before recovering money from the Energy Department , which it estimates could amount to $ 350 million , or the income from the sale of scrap metal .
Still , the retirement comes at a time of rapid cost inflation .
Last month , Mr. Dusaniwskyj told stock analysts in a conference call organized by UBS Investment Research that the utilities ’ estimate of the cost of decommissioning was rising 8 to 9 percent a year , pushed by the cost of burying the lightly contaminated concrete and steel .
That cost could change markedly in coming years , depending on whether more low-level radioactive waste dumps open .
Representative Edward J. Markey , a <START:location> Massachusetts <END> Democrat , said in a letter sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday that several reactor owners had recently filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Those documents indicated that their plants were worth far less than previously assumed , since the market price of the electricity they produced had dropped sharply because of low natural gas prices .
( That is what made Kewaunee unprofitable . )
Earlier this year , he pointed out , the owners of the Crystal River 3 plant in <START:location> Florida <END> decided to retire it rather than repair its containment structure , because of unfavorable economics .
Industry experts say that several reactors are operating at a loss while their owners wait for the glut of natural gas to disappear .
How long that will be , and how many will last , is not clear .
“Once these old nuclear reactors shut down — as we’re seeing now — it will take 60 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to decontaminate them , ” Mr. Markey said in a statement .
“ Taxpayers should have assurances that these nuclear relics don’t outlive their corporate owners and their ability to fund nuclear cleanup costs , leaving ordinary Americans to foot the bill . ”
The concern is relatively new because in the past , reactors were locally owned , so their economic benefits — or their costs — accrued for a population that a utility could appeal to for money if it ran short .
Mr. Heacock noted , however , that this was never assured .
A public service commission might tell such a utility , “you collected the money already , you figure out how to make it work , or go to your shareholders for the difference , ” he said .
Dominion filed plans in February to shut down the reactor .
Mr. Heacock said that the experience of another company , Energy Solutions , which is decommissioning Commonwealth Edison’s old Zion reactors north of <START:location> Chicago <END> , was that it might be cheaper to do the job in the next decade or so .
Decommissioning Kewaunee will require equipment that is available now , and also human skills , including the intimate knowledge gained by workers who have been at the site for years .
“After 10 years , people knowledgeable about the plant were no longer around , ” he said of the Zion reactors .

AN old Viennese saying to the effect that " the situation is hopeless but not serious " seems to sum up what several <START:location> Madison Avenue <END> thought leaders believe lies in store for the industry next year .
The senior executives , in presentations on Monday at an annual media conference , predicted that the rough times the advertising business has endured for the last several years would continue into 2015 .
Still , there will be steady growth in worldwide advertising spending of 4.8 to 5 percent compared with this year , according to their forecasts , as a result of factors that include gains in digital ad sales and improving economic conditions in markets like <START:location> India <END> and the <START:location> United States <END> .
The better outcome the executives anticipate for 2015 compared with 2014 may not warrant dancing a Viennese waltz , but would be respectable , they suggested , in light of the many issues that worry them and marketer clients .
" If anybody in this room thinks life is easy , " said Martin Sorrell , chief executive of WPP , the world 's largest agency holding group in revenue , " think again . "
He cited a news story late last week in London , where WPP is based , reporting that a giant marketer , Premier Foods , "was asking its suppliers , including advertising agencies , to pay a sort of toll or fee to earn the right " to continue doing business with the company in what is called a pay-and-stay arrangement .
Although Premier executives subsequently "withdrew " those requests , Mr. Sorrell said , it underscored " the tough economic position " of advertisers and how " the pressure to reduce costs " is now a constant .
" The biggest challenge we face as an industry is convincing clients to focus on the top line rather than reducing costs , " he added , and to realize that ad spending is " an investment , not a cost . "
As for agencies , Mr. Sorrell said , " the pressure is intensifying " in areas like payment terms , where clients want more leeway .
Yet in a tough , troubled climate , it will be " the same again " for ad spending next year as it was this year , he added : trudging ahead from the previous year despite "gray swans " -- Mr. Sorrell 's term for " known unknowns " that plays off "black swans , " or unforeseen crises .
Mr. Sorrell spoke during the first day of the 42nd annual UBS Global Media and Communications Conference , which continues in <START:location> Midtown Manhattan <END> through Wednesday .
His wide-ranging remarks -- which included predictions that no party may be able to form a government after the British election next year and that Hillary Rodham Clinton would be elected president in 2016 -- followed the morning keynote , a panel of three media agency leaders offering ad forecasts .
Conditions in the ad and media industry are "unrelentingly tough , " Steve King , chief executive of the ZenithOptimedia division of the Publicis Groupe said in an interview , "because everyone 's trying to squeeze you " and " the pain for not getting it right is greater " than it used to be .
Despite its being " a hard slog , " he added , the business "is in reasonably good shape " because of growth in digital ad spending , "almost entirely coming from newspapers and magazines " ; robust gains in mobile ad spending ; and improvements in " steady-growth " markets like <START:location> Australia <END> and the <START:location> United States <END> as well as "fast-growth " markets like <START:location> China <END> , <START:location> India <END> and <START:location> Latin America <END> .
A second panelist , Vincent Letang , executive vice president and director for global forecasting at the Magna Global unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies , said he expected the outcome for 2015 to be " not fantastic , but a decent performance . "
After that , he added , worldwide ad growth " will fluctuate between 5 and 6 percent a year . "
A third panelist , Adam Smith , futures director of GroupM , owned by WPP , wondered how much ad spending may pick up if oil prices , which have sharply declined recently , remain low or head lower .
That would be "quite a strong positive , " he said , because marketers could run more ads to woo consumers who have more to spend as they spend less for gasoline .
Mr. Smith 's forecast for 4.9 percent worldwide ad spending growth in 2015 compared with this year is predicated , he said , on continued gains for digital ads as some ad markets that previously grew rapidly slow down or , in the case of <START:location> Russia <END> , turn negative .
As for television ad spending , Mr. Smith cast doubt on some predictions that it would decline significantly soon or that digital ad spending would increase at the expense of television .
" Print is the organ donor for digital , " he said , adding : " Print was low-hanging fruit for the Internet .
TV dollars are much further up in the canopy . "
Another speaker , David F. Poltrack , chief research officer of a television giant , the CBS Corporation , acknowledged difficulties for the medium like "resistance in the upfront market " from advertisers that balked at buying commercial time before the start of the 2014-15 season and " a mercurial scatter market " -- buying commercial time during the season -- " that fluctuates from day to day . "
Viewers are certainly watching more streaming video , Mr. Poltrack said , but decisions to shift ad dollars there from television may be premature until more reliable measurement of viewing habits is available .
Digital media is not necessarily antithetical to television , he added , noting that "one million people are watching ' The Big Bang Theory ' on cbs.com " rather than on the CBS broadcast network .
Mr. Smith of GroupM said much the same thing , telling the audience , " If we are going to be predicting doom for TV , let 's look at the numbers first . "

Updated , 8:47 p.m. | Deal making in the health care industry has been booming all year , with medical technology companies and cosmetic drug makers changing hands at rich premiums .
Now a different part of the industry — antibiotics — is at the center of the mergers and acquisitions frenzy .
Merck & Company said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals for $ 8.4 billion , plus the assumption of $ 1.1 billion in debt .
The deal will give Merck , the second-largest American drug maker after Pfizer , control of the largest antibiotics company , and deepen its ties with hospitals .
The deal fits into Merck’s strategy of buying midsize drug makers that complement its existing products .
Merck will pay $ 102 a share in cash for Cubist , a 35 percent premium above Cubist’s average share price for the five most recent trading days .
Cubist , based in <START:location> Lexington , Mass. <END> , makes drugs to treat dangerous bacteria and superbugs , including diseases that can cause pandemics .
Its biggest seller , Cubicin , fits nicely into Merck’s hospital division , one of four areas that executives recently identified as priorities for the company .
Sales in Merck’s hospital acute care division were 10 percent higher in the first three quarters of this year than in the same period last year .
Drug makers are showing renewed interest in antibiotics now that the Food and Drug Administration is offering incentives to manufacturers to invest in new products .
Until recently , drug makers had shied away from developing new antibiotics because there was little financial motivation to do so .
“Large pharma had evacuated the space about a decade ago , ” said Liisa Bayko , an analyst at JMP Securities .
“There were a number of regulatory hurdles with the F.D.A. that were getting very onerous . ”
But now , companies that develop antibiotics can qualify for speedier approvals and can sell their products exclusively for longer periods as part of an effort to combat the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant diseases .
And last year , the federal government announced an agreement to pay GlaxoSmithKline $ 40 million to help it develop drugs that could fight antibiotic resistance and biological agents that terrorists might use .
Merck said the deal with Cubist was about expanding revenue , rather than looking for cost savings .
“The rationale for this deal is revenue growth , ” Kenneth C. Frazier , Merck’s chief executive , said in a telephone interview on Monday .
“Our ability to take these products and take them , for example , globally where we have strength around the world is a great opportunity to grow . ”
Cubist has promising drugs in the pipeline , including those it obtained through two corporate acquisitions of its own .
Cubist bought Optimer and Trius last year , paying about $ 800 million for each .
For Merck , buying Cubist allowed it to instantly bolster its presence in antibiotics .
Cubist is alone among companies of its size in having a robust portfolio of antibiotics .
“This is the only company that has multiple antibiotics , ” Ms. Bayko said .
“If you wanted to get in in a big way , this is the only way to do it . ”
By selling to Merck , Cubist will be able to expand internationally at a faster clip .
Cubist antibiotics are sold only in the United States and Canada , though the company was working on expanding to Western Europe .
“With Merck taking over we have access to this Class A infrastructure around the world , ” said Michael Bonney , Cubist’s chief executive .
Merck also said it saw opportunity in expanding sales of Cubist’s products around the world .
International sales of Cubist’s products made up just 6 percent of the company ’s revenues in the first nine months of this year .
Mr. Frazier said that Merck would continue to buy smaller companies such as Cubist , rather than focus on a megamerger like the $ 66 billion takeover of the Botox maker Allergan by Actavis .
“We’re an innovation-focused company , ” he said .
“We will use business development and M&A to get access to the best science that we can .
We’re not as interested in doing a large consolidation merger that is driven by cost synergies .
A large consolidation transaction to us would be a distraction . ”
Merck approached Cubist about a deal earlier this year , Mr. Bonney said in an interview .
“As we worked with them , the board decided to do a very thorough market check , ” Mr. Bonney said .
“We did have multiple interested parties , but Merck offered the best price and was the best fit . ”
The $ 8.4 billion price has been approved unanimously by the boards of both companies and includes the assumption of about $ 1.1 billion in debt , bringing the enterprise value of the deal to $ 9.5 billion .
Merck , through a subsidiary , will begin a tender offer to investors to acquire all of Cubist’s outstanding shares .
Shares of Cubist jumped 35 percent on Monday , to about $ 100.60 .
Merck shares closed 0.6 percent higher , at $ 61.88 .
“We’re certainly satisfied with the price we got for shareholders , ” Mr. Bonney said .
The deal , which is subject to approval by regulators , is expected to close in the first quarter .
DealBook reported that a deal was in the works after the market closed on Friday .
Last month , Cubist posted third-quarter sales of $ 309 million , a 16 percent increase from the period a year earlier .
Merck makes vaccines , prescription products and oncology treatments .
It posted revenue of about $ 10.6 billion in the third quarter .
It said Cubist would add more than $ 1 billion to its expected 2015 revenues .
The deal is the latest bolt-on acquisition for Merck , which has been looking to bolster its portfolio of drugs even as it faces increased competition from generic drug producers .
It agreed in June , for example , to a $ 3.85 billion deal for Idenix Pharmaceuticals , a maker of treatments for hepatitis C.
But Merck has also shed noncore businesses .
Earlier this year , it sold its consumer business to Bayer for $ 14.2 billion .
JPMorgan Chase , Deutsche Bank and the law firms Hughes Hubbard & Reed and Baker & McKenzie advised Merck , while Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs and the law firm Ropes & Gray advised Cubist .

<START:location> NEW DELHI <END> — The Delhi region on Monday banned Uber , the popular hail-a-ride service , after one of its drivers appeared in court on suspicion of raping a passenger who dozed off during a ride home only to discover that the driver had taken her to a secluded spot and climbed into the back of the vehicle .
Criticism of Uber’s licensing and screening procedures was heightened when it emerged that the driver , Shiv Kumar Yadav , had been detained for seven months on suspicion of raping another female passenger three years ago .
That case was ultimately closed and Mr. Yadav was acquitted , said Madhur Verma , the deputy commissioner of the police for the northern district of <START:location> New Delhi <END> .
Regional authorities followed up late on Monday by banning all taxi services based on smartphone apps , which may result in the closure of as many as 20 popular services .
Since its launch last December , Uber had gained a large following among young , tech-savvy women in Delhi , where finding safe transportation after dark is especially difficult .
But the new service — which uses a smartphone app to link customers with available drivers — ran afoul of well-established taxi firms and with government regulators , who saw so-called aggregators as ducking legal and safety obligations shouldered by ordinary city cabs .
Uber is running into similar problems in cities in other countries .
A Dutch court on Monday prohibited the UberPop service , which links clients with drivers who do not have professional licenses , from operating in the Netherlands .
The UberPop service has been banned in the German cities of <START:location> Berlin <END> and <START:location> Hamburg <END> , and London ’s main taxi association has brought lawsuits against Uber and a number of its drivers .
Lawmakers in <START:location> Thailand <END> and <START:location> Vietnam <END> have banned the service , and the city government in <START:location> Seoul <END> has said it plans to do the same .
None of these cases were as dramatic , though , as the one unfolding here .
<START:location> Delhi <END> has yet to recover from a brutal rape that took place two years ago , when a woman returning home after seeing a movie boarded a private bus with a male companion and was gang-raped so brutally that she later died of her injuries .
A wave of street demonstrations followed that crime , and the authorities appeared to be braced on Monday for turbulence that did not materialize .
As the driver , Mr. Yadav , left a courthouse in <START:location> Delhi <END> , he was surrounded by around three dozen police officers who whisked him away at a sprint .
Uber executives , too , seemed to be girding themselves for a fight .
The company ’s chief executive , Travis Kalanick , issued a statement saying that Uber “will work with the government to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs . ”
He also said Uber would try to use technological advances “to help make <START:location> New Delhi <END> a safer city for women . ”
“ What happened over the weekend in <START:location> New Delhi <END> is horrific , ” the statement said .
“Our entire team’s hearts go out to the victim of this despicable crime .
We will do everything , I repeat , everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice and support the victim and her family in her recovery . ”
Women here are severely constrained by the difficulty of finding safe transportation after dark .
In an essay published Monday , one high-ranking news executive recalled working late on a story early in her career and being mortified when her father called to berate her editor for exposing her to danger , “reducing me to a helpless little girl in front of my boss . ”
Uber attracted business swiftly , in part because its marketing material focused so squarely on safety .
Much of the reaction to the reported rape has had a tinge of betrayal .
“Uber was the one thing that gave me the confidence to feel independent in <START:location> Delhi <END> , which you don’t feel here , ” said Neha Sinha , 28 , who said she had used the service regularly for the last six months .
“Now I’m back to square one . ”
Ayesha Perera , in a commentary on the news website Firstpost , said she had become equally relaxed about late-night cab rides , and could sympathize with the reported victim .
“It is likely that she was sufficiently relaxed to nod off precisely because she believed she was safe in an Uber , ” she wrote .
The woman , who is in her late 20s and works at a finance company , was returning from <START:location> New Delhi <END> to her home in nearby Gurgaon on Friday night .
She said she awoke after Mr. Yadav had changed his route , taking her to a secluded area not far from a garbage dump .
He then parked and raped her , she told the police early Saturday morning .
Mr. Verma , the police investigator , said a physical examination showed signs of a “fierce sexual assault and rape . ”
The police said the woman took a photograph of the cab , including its license plate , using the camera on her mobile phone , which she provided to the police .
Mr. Yadav was arrested Sunday night , when police burst into a house where he had barricaded himself , in his native village 90 miles southeast of <START:location> New Delhi <END> .
During questioning , Mr. Yadav confessed to raping his passenger on Friday , as well as another woman he drove home in 2011 , Mr. Verma said .
It remains unclear how Mr. Yadav was hired given the previous allegations against him .
In 2011 , then driving a cab for another service , he picked up a 22-year-old woman who needed to go home after working a night shift at a bar .
She later told the police he had driven her to a farmhouse and raped her ; a medical examination confirmed a sexual assault .
Uber does not conduct background checks on its drivers in <START:location> India <END> , one of its local executives , Neeraj Singhal , told The Wall Street Journal last month .
It accepts partner drivers if they have valid insurance documents , a driver’s license and a commercial permit to drive a taxi , he said .
The Delhi Transport Department acknowledged , in a statement , that it had granted Mr. Yadav an “All-India Tourist Permit ” this May , “after due verification of character and antecedents of the permit holder . ”
It added , however , that such a permit did not authorize him to carry local fares within <START:location> Delhi <END> .
Police investigators have been scathing in describing their dealings with Uber .
Mr. Verma said he was unable to find any contact number or email address for Uber on its web pages and finally located its headquarters by booking an Uber cab and asking to be taken to the company ’s head office , which turned out to be several rooms in a hotel .
He said he was not able to get any information about Friday ’s bookings for five hours because the database was in New York .
Mr. Verma also said that Uber had failed to demand that Mr. Yadav show a badge , which can only be acquired by submitting to a criminal background check .
He said Uber had registered Mr. Yadav under an inaccurate residential address , had not registered his vehicle as a cab , and had not installed a global positioning system in the vehicle , which is mandatory for commercial taxis .
In fact , Uber and other “aggregators , ” as they are known , manage to duck regulations that apply to traditional city cabs — including the requirement that each driver possess a badge , said Kunal Lalani , the president of the Association of Radio Taxis .
Mr. Lalani said “this new technology business , ” including Uber , had initially focused on “the luxury segment , ” and that risks had only begun to increase as they expanded into what he called “the entry-level segment . ”
“ Unfortunately , this guy was a single taxi owner , and he went and joined Uber , ” he said .
“As long as Uber was doing premium services , there was never a problem .
There was always going to be an owner who was vigilant .
They have now gone on to the entry-level services . ”

<START:location> SEOUL , South Korea <END> — <START:location> North Korea <END> on Sunday denied responsibility for hacking the computers of Sony Pictures Entertainment but appeared to relish the attack that crippled the computer systems of the <START:location> Hollywood <END> company , which is set to release a comedy that involves a plot to assassinate its leader , Kim Jong-un .
Sony Pictures is producing “a film abetting a terrorist act while hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership , ” a spokesman of the National Defense Commission , Mr. Kim’s top governing agency in <START:location> Pyongyang <END> , was quoted as saying by the North’s Korean Central News Agency .
The spokesman said <START:location> North Korea <END> did not know why Sony was targeted , but he speculated that the attack “might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with ” <START:location> North Korea <END> in its struggle to “put an end to U.S. imperialism . ”
A hacking attack last month shut down the computer systems of Sony Pictures and exposed a trove of internal data , including salary figures .
<START:location> North Korea <END> has since emerged as a possible suspect because it has been criticizing Sony Pictures for producing “The Interview , ” a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that involves the assassination plot against Mr. Kim .
<START:location> North Korea <END> saw no humor there .
It has called the movie “an act of war ” sponsored by <START:location> Washington <END> ’s “hostile policy . ”
Mr. Kim’s family has been ruling <START:location> North Korea <END> since the late 1940s with a totalitarian grip that has rested upon a personality cult .
The government in <START:location> Pyongyang <END> lashes out at any attempt from the outside to criticize Mr. Kim , calling it a challenge to the “supreme dignity ” of the entire country .
It has been especially sensitive about such criticism in recent weeks because there was an American-supported attempt at the United Nations to ask the Security Council to refer Mr. Kim to an international criminal court for human rights abuses .
No direct evidence has emerged yet that links <START:location> North Korea <END> to the hacking attack at Sony Pictures , and digital-security analysts have been divided over the likelihood of its involvement .
On Sunday , <START:location> North Korea <END> said there were “a great number of supporters and sympathizers ” with <START:location> North Korea <END> “all over the world , ” including “champions of peace ” who might initiate more “righteous reaction ” against the <START:location> United States’ <END> “evildoings . ”
South Korean and American officials have been increasingly concerned about <START:location> North Korea’s <END> capability to carry out attacks on computers , especially after huge disruptions of bank , government , media and military websites in <START:location> South Korea <END> in recent years that <START:location> South Korea <END> attributed to attacks sponsored by the North .
<START:location> North Korea <END> has denied involvement and instead blamed <START:location> South Korea <END> for disrupting its websites in recent years .
<START:location> North Korea <END> itself is cut off from the Internet , except for a handful of state-approved websites linked to the World Wide Web.
But South Korean officials and defectors from <START:location> North Korea <END> said <START:location> North Korea <END> has been training specialists in computer attacks for decades to collect technological data through the Internet , spread the country ’s propaganda online and initiate hacking attacks .
In a report to Congress last year , the United States Defense Department said that given its bleak economic outlook , <START:location> North Korea <END> might see hacking attacks as “a cost-effective way to develop asymmetric , deniable military options . ”
In October , <START:location> South Korea’s <END> National Intelligence Service told lawmakers that North Korean-sponsored hackers had spread game apps containing malicious viruses from May through September , affecting an estimated 20,000 South Korean smartphone users .
It did not reveal how it determined that such attacks were sponsored by <START:location> North Korea <END> .

One summer day two years ago , Ivan Vesic , a software engineer who lives in the southern Serbian city of <START:location> Nis <END> , rushed to a local veterinary clinic .
A car had hit his rescue cat , Damian , badly damaging his leg and tail .
The vet , Mirza Sejdinovic , had to amputate the cat’s tail but managed to save his leg .
Mr. Vesic sighed with relief ; Damian was going to be fine .
The two men began to chat and Mr. Sejdinovic complained about the software at his clinic .
Mr. Vesic looked at the computer screen and quickly concluded there must be a better way to manage a veterinary practice .
In the following weeks Mr. Vesic and Mr. Sejdinovic realized they could do something much more ambitious — create user-friendly software to be used by vet practices all over the world .
“We decided that we should actually quit our jobs and start building a start-up , ” Mr. Vesic said , adding that the team was joined by a third partner , Milan Djordjevic , a programmer .
Their company , VetCloud , was born .
More than two years later , after extensive testing in the <START:location> Balkans <END> and <START:location> Britain <END> , its practice management software was introduced in <START:location> London <END> in November .
Mr. Vesic , 28 , Mr. Sejdinovic , 30 , and Mr. Djordjevic , 36 , are among hundreds of entrepreneurs in the <START:location> Balkans <END> who have launched tech start-ups that they hope to take global , at the same time transforming this ex-communist , relatively poor corner of <START:location> Europe <END> — known best abroad as war-torn , corrupt and unstable — into a hub for technology and innovation .
“ I believe it ’s only a matter of time before we have a Skype-level success from the region , ” said Lyuben Belov , managing partner at Launchub , a seed fund based in the Bulgarian capital , <START:location> Sofia <END> , which invests in digital start-ups in southeast <START:location> Europe <END> .
“Someone will make it big on the global market , ” he added , predicting that a Balkan company would be traded on the Nasdaq in <START:location> New York <END> one day .
Some Balkan start-ups , like Emailio , a company co-founded by a Bulgarian high school student working on a mobile app to de-clutter inboxes , have moved to <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> .
Flipps , an app that lets users stream video from mobile devices to a television , has also swapped <START:location> Bulgaria <END> for the <START:location> Bay Area <END> .
In another fillip for the region’s start-ups , Facebook announced in July that it was buying LiveRail , a video ad company co-founded by two Romanians , for a reported $ 400 million to $ 500 million .
In October , Progress Software , based in <START:location> Bedford , Mass. <END> , said it planned to acquire Telerik , a Bulgarian software company , for $ 262.5 million .
For years , big international companies have outsourced information technology work to <START:location> Eastern Europe <END> .
They have been attracted by relatively cheap labor , low rent and a pool of qualified software developers , whose skills reflect a tradition of strong math and engineering education that goes back to communist times .
Low business taxes help — <START:location> Bulgaria <END> , for example , offers a flat rate of 10 percent .
Now , those very same reasons are encouraging Balkan entrepreneurs to start their own businesses .
But the <START:location> Balkans <END> are up against tough competition from <START:location> Europe’s <END> top start-up destinations , like <START:location> London <END> , <START:location> Berlin <END> , <START:location> Helsinki <END> and <START:location> Stockholm <END> , where access to venture capital is easier and the start-up scene is much more advanced .
While Balkan entrepreneurs are blessed with ambition , tech know-how and enthusiasm , these would-be billionaires also face red tape , a dearth of government incentives and their own lack of business experience .
Balkan governments are slowly getting more involved in the sector .
Serbia has an Innovation Fund financed by the European Union , which has awarded 53 grants , amounting to €6 million so far .
Sofia is building a €50 million technology park — also with funding from <START:location> Brussels <END> — to link local businesses and universities and foster innovation .
President Rosen Plevneliev of <START:location> Bulgaria <END> declared at a groundbreaking ceremony in July that it would be “the heart of start-up culture ” in the country .
Back in <START:location> Nis <END> , VetCloud’s team has been developing a cloud-based software for vets , which stores medical records , handles appointments and sends alerts when new supplies of medicine are needed .
To win investment for their company , they did not go to <START:location> Belgrade <END> , the Serbian capital , but to <START:location> Sofia <END> , where more tech money resides .
“ While there was a community in <START:location> Belgrade <END> , there was already an ecosystem in <START:location> Sofia <END> , ” said Mr. Vesic , the company ’s chief executive .
The firm has received €200,000 from Eleven , an accelerator fund that offers a training and mentorship program in return for a stake in the companies it supports .
The VetCloud team spent three months in <START:location> Bulgaria <END> , learning the nuts and bolts of starting and running a tech company .
“We got the money and advice we needed , ” Mr. Vesic said .
Launchub and Eleven manage a total of €21 million as part of a European Union-sponsored initiative to support small and midsize businesses , named Jeremie .
They have distributed €9 million among 120 start-ups from the region in the past two years and plan to fund around 200 firms by 2015 .
In comparison , German and international venture capitalists in <START:location> Berlin <END> invested €133 million in start-ups in 2012 , according to a McKinsey study from last year .
But a small amount of funding goes a long way in the <START:location> Balkans <END> , where costs for starting a business are much lower than those in <START:location> Berlin <END> or <START:location> London <END> .
Entrepreneurs have had to overcome the long tradition of outsourcing in the Balkans to want to work for themselves and come up with the next must-have app or big e-business success .
Milos Milic , a 25-year-old Serbian IT developer , is part of the new generation .
Last December , he and his business partner , Srdjan Stupar , quit their jobs to start Farmia , an online exchange for livestock .
Mr. Milic described the change as the best thing that has ever happened to him .
“We have smaller salaries now , but we have a chance to build our own company , ” he said .
Until recently , Serbian start-ups had to look abroad for financing .
But funds like StartLabs , launched last year , aim to fill this gap , offering funding of up to $ 50,000 and connecting firms with mentors and foreign investors .
“This is the best time to start something like this , ” said Nebojsa Lazic , the StartLabs ’ general partner .
Things have changed , he added , since the days when entrepreneurs were half-jokingly called “superheroes with suicidal tendencies” .
Unlike <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> companies , which have access to hundreds of millions of consumers in the <START:location> United States <END> alone , Balkan firms are based in a region fragmented into small markets .
But Dilyan Dimitrov , one of Eleven’s founders , says this can be a plus as it forces regional start-ups to develop ideas with broader appeal .
“Everyone who is starting a tech product is very much aware that they have to make a global-scalable product , ” he said .
Playground Energy , based in <START:location> Sofia <END> , is trying to do exactly that .
The company makes playground equipment that generates electricity from children’s play .
The electricity powers lights , sounds and other effects to encourage the children to play longer .
The company ’s co-founder , Hristo Alexiev , says that being based in Bulgaria gives the company significant advantages .
It can pursue a strategy of global growth while using local designers and developers .
That keeps costs low , making the most of the €200,000 it has secured in investment .
“If we moved to <START:location> America <END> , we’d have spent half of the money just on the move , rent , lawyers , ” said Mr. Alexiev , who , at 44 , talks about Playground Energy , his sixth start-up , with the enthusiasm of a 17-year-old launching his first business .
But others have chosen a different path , moving to <START:location> London <END> or <START:location> Berlin <END> , where they believe they can grow faster .
Unioncy , an online platform designed to let people keep track of their purchases and store their warranties , bills , insurance and manuals all in one place , moved from <START:location> Sofia <END> to <START:location> London <END> , where they found more investment opportunities .
But Unioncy’s fate shows that moving to a big tech hub is no guarantee of success .
The business quickly went from start-up to shutdown , announcing its demise at the end of October due to “larger than anticipated technical challenges . ”
VetCloud , the Serbian start-up , also established a presence in <START:location> London <END> after receiving financing and mentoring from the British office of TechStars , an international fund .
“We decided to move where our market is , ” said Mr. Vesic .
While start-ups in the <START:location> Balkans <END> hope for a big breakthrough , one nearby ex-communist country has already scored a string of international successes .
<START:location> Hungary <END> was the launch pad for companies including Prezi , the popular cloud-based presentation software ; Ustream , a live video-streaming platform ; and LogMeIn , which gives users remote access to their computers .
Prezi was created in 2009 as an alternative to Microsoft’s ubiquitous PowerPoint .
Five years later , it has 45 million users around the world .
For a co-founder , Peter Halacsy , the key to start-up success is “not the money , it ’s not the infrastructure , not the legal system ” but changing the way people think — getting away from a stuffy , risk-averse , communist-era mentality .
Along with Ustream and LogMeIn , Prezi created a nongovernmental organization called Bridge Budapest that aims to help and inspire a new generation of Hungarian entrepreneurs .
“ Here , parents tell their kids : ‘Don’t try , it ’s risky .
Go work in a bank , that would be better for you , " ’ said Veronika Pistyur , the organization’s chief executive .
“Now I can see that more and more people are willing to try . ”
But , so far , newer Hungarian start-ups have not managed to reach the same level of success as Prezi and the other established stars of <START:location> Budapest’s <END> tech scene .
Back in the <START:location> Balkans <END> , investors are under no illusions that the region will become another <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> , but some say it could still play a worthwhile role in the international tech scene .
“ What can develop here is a kind of incubator for talents — places that yield people with interesting ideas , ” said Maxim Gurvits , a partner at Sofia-based Teres Capital , which plans to start a venture capital fund to invest in startups in Central and Eastern <START:location> Europe <END> .
“So , the next time you want to create a company , you go to <START:location> Sofia <END> , not <START:location> New York <END> , because it ’s very expensive there . ”
While the <START:location> Balkans <END> may have plenty of coders , investors say the shortage of people with business experience is a serious disadvantage .
For Mr. Belov , from Launchub , “the only way to have a big success is to have the developers here but the sales and marketing outsourced to places where those skills are developed to perfection , like <START:location> London <END> and <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> . ”
Some tech entrepreneurs also want more immediate and practical help .
Some point to the example of the British government , which offers big tax breaks to investors in start-ups and the companies themselves .
“All start-ups need tax benefits and a more relaxed tax system during the first year or two , ” said Danica Radisic , a Belgrade-based entrepreneur .
Despite current obstacles , the coders keep working on their big ideas .
In addition to its launch in <START:location> Britain <END> , VetCloud has been negotiating partnerships with distributors in the <START:location> United States <END> .
Mr. Vesic dreams big .
“If you use Dropbox to sync your files , if you use Google to search the Internet , you’ll use VetCloud to manage vets ’ medical records , ” he said .

<START:location> WASHINGTON <END> — When President Obama laid out his vision for strict regulation of Internet access last month , he was voicing views thought to be held by many at the most liberal end of the Democratic Party .
A few days later , however , the N.A.A.C.P. , the National Urban League and the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition sent representatives , including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson , to tell Tom Wheeler , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , that they thought Mr. Obama’s call to regulate broadband Internet service as a utility would harm minority communities by stifling investment in underserved areas and entrenching already dominant Internet companies .
Their displeasure should not be read as a sign that most civil rights organizations were unhappy with Mr. Obama’s plan , however .
When it comes to the details of Internet regulation , groups that otherwise have much common ground simply don’t see eye to eye .
ColorofChange .org , a black political coalition , and the National Hispanic Media Coalition , for example , support treating Internet access as an essential service like electricity or water — as Mr. Obama proposed — while the League of United Latin American Citizens opposes it .
“The civil rights community is like every sector anywhere .
While from the outside it seems like a monolith , it is not , ” said Cheryl A. Leanza , a policy adviser for the United Church of Christ Office of Communication .
Though she was part of the 11-member group that included Mr. Jackson , she asked the chairman to embrace the president ’s plan .
The debate is but one slice of a huge campaign to lobby the five F.C.C. commissioners as they weigh net neutrality , the concept that all Internet traffic should be treated equally , and whether to reclassify broadband as a more heavily regulated service .
Since 2002 , broadband has been classified as a Title I information service under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 , meaning that the F.C.C. lightly regulates it .
Title II services include “common carriers ” like telephone companies , whose rates the F.C.C. can regulate and whose business plans often require the commission’s approval .
In May , Mr. Wheeler made a proposal that would allow companies to pay Internet providers to give them a “fast lane ” to consumers .
Mr. Wheeler is against that practice , known as paid prioritization , and he said his proposal would discourage it .
But the regulatory outline released by the F.C.C. would still allow for paid prioritization in some circumstances , a loophole that was seized on by opponents .
President Obama urged the F.C.C. to reclassify broadband as a Title II service , which would generally give the commission the authority to prohibit broadband providers from blocking or discriminating against legal online content .
In the four weeks since Mr. Obama’s move , over 100 companies , industry groups and coalitions have met with commissioners and their staffs .
At least 67 of those groups have met with Mr. Wheeler himself — nearly four a day , on average .
Included in those meetings have been civil rights groups with surprisingly divergent views .
The unusual alignments can also be seen in urban governments .
The cities of <START:location> Baltimore <END> , <START:location> Chicago <END> , <START:location> Los Angeles <END> and <START:location> San Francisco <END> sent representatives to meet with Mr. Wheeler’s advisers to say they agreed with tight regulation , but that view is opposed by the National Organization of Blacks in Government .
“ I think we’re all on board with the values embedded in what President Obama said , things like accelerating broadband deployment and adoption , ” said Nicol Turner-Lee , vice president of the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council and a member of the group including Mr. Jackson that met with the F.C.C. chairman .
“The question is , will we be able to solve these issues by going so far with stringent regulation ? ”
Some of the groups that oppose Title II designation , like the Urban League and the League of United Latin American Citizens , have received contributions from organizations affiliated with Internet service providers , like the Comcast Foundation , the charitable organization endowed by Comcast .
Parts of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition’s annual symposium on civil rights were conducted last week at Comcast’s offices in <START:location> Washington <END> .
But those organizations say that the donations or sponsorships do not influence their positions .
“We get support from people on all sides of the issue , including Google and Facebook , ” said Brent A. Wilkes , national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens .
“We don’t let any of them influence our position . ”
Several of those favoring Title II , meanwhile , have received funding from organizations affiliated with companies that support stronger regulation .
The National Hispanic Media Coalition conducts events that are sponsored in part by companies like Google and Facebook .
A trade organization sponsored by those and other Internet companies , the Internet Association , supports a shift to stricter regulation .
Jessica Gonzalez , executive vice president of the National Hispanic Media Coalition , said her organization also received support from Comcast for some of its programs .
“There is a clear separation between our policy work and who funds us , ” she said .
One of the primary disagreements among the civil rights groups is over a practice known as “zero rating , ” in which an Internet service provider makes a deal with a content provider like Facebook or Spotify to allow consumers unlimited access to that service without its counting against a cap on data usage .
Because zero-rating plans are most common among mobile broadband providers , those plans could particularly affect minority communities , Ms. Turner-Lee said , which are more likely to depend on mobile systems for Internet access .
It is not entirely clear how Mr. Obama’s plan would affect zero-rated apps .
“The relevant question is whether there is something to be said about zero-rating plans and the ways that they can be used to further Internet adoption , ” Ms. Turner-Lee said , adding that her group had not yet taken a stance .
But critics say that zero-rating programs are just a form of paid prioritization that could further entrench companies like Facebook that have the financial muscle to pay for the privilege .
According to the Mobile Trends Charging Report by Allot Communications , nearly half of mobile broadband providers worldwide offer at least one zero-rated app , and two-thirds of those offer Facebook as one .
The alignment of civil rights groups both for and against Mr. Obama’s recommendation for net-neutrality enforcement is not the only oddity in this debate .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled that the F.C.C. acted within the law when it classified cable broadband as a lightly regulated information service .
Writing a stinging dissent to that decision — that is , saying that broadband was obviously more like a utility — was an otherwise frequent nemesis of Democrats : Justice Antonin Scalia .

Ralph H. Baer , who turned television sets into electronic fantasy lands by inventing and patenting the first home video game system , died on Saturday at his home in <START:location> Manchester , N.H. <END>
He was 92 .
His death was confirmed by his family .
Video games have become more than just a ubiquitous pastime and a gigantic market ( by some estimates , total worldwide sales of console hardware and software and online , mobile and computer games exceeded $ 90 billion in 2013 ) .
They are also an engine that has driven scientists and engineers to multiply computer speed , memory and visualization to today’s staggering capabilities .
Flash back to the sultry late summer of 1966 : Mr. Baer is sitting on a step outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal in <START:location> Manhattan <END> waiting for a colleague .
By profession , he is an engineer overseeing 500 employees at a military contractor .
Today , a vision has gripped him , and he begins scribbling furiously on a yellow legal pad with a No. 2 pencil .
The result was a detailed four-page outline for a “game box ” that would allow people to play board , action , sports and other games on almost any American television set .
An intrigued boss gave him $ 2,000 for research and $ 500 for materials and assigned two men to work with him .
For all three , as they plowed through prototype after prototype in a secret workshop , the project became an obsession .
In March 1971 , Mr. Baer and his employer , Sanders Associates in <START:location> Nashua , N.H. <END> , filed for the first video game patent , which was granted in April 1973 as Patent No. 3,728,480 .
It made an extraordinarily large claim to a legal monopoly for any product that included a domestic television with circuits capable of producing and controlling dots on a screen .
Sanders Associates licensed its system to Magnavox , which began selling it as Odyssey in the summer of 1972 as the first home video game console .
It sold 130,000 units the first year .
Odyssey consisted of a master control unit containing all the electronic gear , two player control units that directed players on the TV screen , and a set of electronic program cards , each of which supported a different game .
Plastic overlays that clung to the screen to supply color were included .
To supplement the electronic action , a deck of playing cards , poker chips and a pair of dice were included .
But the guts of the device were what mattered : 40 transistors and 40 diodes .
That hardware ran everything .
Odyssey , often called the first home computing device , had no software .
Several months after Odyssey hit the market , Atari came out with the first arcade video game , Pong .
Though Pong became better known than Odyssey and was in some ways more agile , Sanders and Magnavox immediately saw it as an infringement on their patent .
They sued Atari in 1974 for usurping their rights .
Atari settled with them by paying $ 700,000 to become Odyssey’s second licensee .
Over the next 20 years , Magnavox went on to sue dozens more companies , winning more than $ 100 million .
Mr. Baer often testified .
“Magnavox is n’t in the business of making video games , ” Howard Lincoln , Nintendo’s vice president and senior counsel , groused in an interview with Newsday in 1989 .
“They’re just in the business of suing people . ”
( Nintendo , like all the game makers Magnavox challenged , lost . )
Mr. Baer’s contraption represented the beginnings of a change in man’s relationship with machines .
Harold Goldberg , in his book “All Your Base Are Belong to Us : How Fifty Years of Videogames Conquered Pop Culture ” ( 2011 ) , said Mr. Baer made television “an extension of you , the player . ”
“It would let you interact with a square on a black-and-white screen , and if you had even the lamest imagination , it made you believe you were volleying at tennis , aiming carefully as a brave marksman , even playing the innocent as you saved lives , ” Mr. Goldberg wrote .
The roots of video games go back to universities and research laboratories .
Some experts cite William A. Higinbotham’s Tennis for Two , invented in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory , as the first interactive computer game .
“ When technology is ready for something novel , when the components needed to build something new become affordable , it is going to be done by someone and more likely by several people , ” wrote Mr. Baer , who said he had never seen Tennis for Two .
From Mr. Baer’s modestly named “brown box ” have sprung PlayStation , Xbox and Wii , all products of the ceaseless revolution in microprocessing .
Two technical paths merged to power this revolution .
One was computer science ; the other was Mr. Baer’s field of expertise , television engineering .
Mr. Baer had more than 150 <START:location> United States <END> and foreign patents , and his contributions ranged from talking doormats and greeting cards to submarine tracking systems .
In 2006 , President George W. Bush awarded him the National Medal of Technology .
In 2010 , he was admitted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame .
Along with Howard Morrison , he invented the electronic game Simon , which was introduced at Studio 54 in <START:location> Manhattan <END> in 1978 and became a pop culture phenomenon in the 1980s .
A saucer-shaped plastic toy with four colored buttons , it lit up and emitted tones in a sequence that the player then had to reproduce .
It is still being sold .
“Coming up with novel ideas and converting them into real products has always been as natural as breathing for me , ” Mr. Baer wrote in his 2005 autobiography , “Videogames : In the Beginning . ”
Ralph Henry Baer was born on March 8 , 1922 , into a Jewish family in <START:location> Pirmasens , Germany <END> , where his father worked in a shoe factory .
His family emigrated to <START:location> New York <END> in 1938 to escape Hitler and settled in the <START:location> Bronx <END> .
Within a week , Mr. Baer , then 16 , was working from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. in a factory that made leather cases for manicure kits .
He soon invented a machine to speed the process by stitching five or six at once .
One day on the subway he noticed an advertisement in a magazine somebody else was reading .
“Make big money in radio and television servicing , ” it said .
So Mr. Baer spent a quarter of his $ 12 in wages every week on a correspondence course .
He finished in a few months , then took the advanced course .
He quit the factory after two years and fixed radios .
He was drafted into the Army in 1943 and became an intelligence officer .
He served in <START:location> Europe <END> during World War II , and in his spare time studied algebra and made radios from German mine detectors so his friends could listen to music .
Trained to be an expert in small arms , he collected 18 tons of German weapons , which were exhibited at military museums in the <START:location> United States <END> .
After the war , Mr. Baer attended the American Television Institute of Technology in <START:location> Chicago <END> , where he earned one of the first bachelor’s degrees in television engineering .
He then worked for a company that made surgical cutting machines , before joining Loral Electronics in the <START:location> Bronx <END> as a senior engineer .
Assigned to design a state-of-the art television set in 1951 , he suggested adding a game-playing feature .
“Forget it , ” he recalled his boss saying .
“ Just build the damn TV set ; you’re behind schedule as it is . ”
In 1956 Mr. Baer joined Sanders , where he advanced to division manager .
As he pursued military projects like electronic devices to teach weapons aiming , his mind returned to the idea of a TV set with a game feature .
Those musings led to his eureka moment at the <START:location> New York <END> bus station .
Still , he said in 2007 , the common reaction of most Sanders executives was , “Are you still screwing around with that stuff ? ”
One top boss , however , saw potential in Mr. Baer’s idea .
He assigned two engineers , Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch , to work with him , and gave the three $ 2,500 to spend .
In a tiny room Mr. Baer described as an attic , they worked in secret , building seven prototypes .
Sanders first tried to license it to pay-TV companies , the forerunners of today’s cable systems , but found no takers .
Television manufacturers were also lukewarm .
RCA expressed interest but backed out .
Magnavox then signed on .
The Odyssey had sold some 330,000 units by 1975 , but Mr. Baer thought it could have sold many more .
He blamed Magnavox for limiting sales to its own dealers , giving the false impression that the system worked only on Magnavox sets .
He also criticized the company for pricing it at $ 100 , rather than the $ 19.95 he recommended .
Odyssey nonetheless represented a critical point .
Along with Atari’s Pong, which had more advanced electronics and sound , it moved games into a faster , more complex realm , to the delight of an eager new audience .
The accomplishment , Mr. Baer wrote , would amount to far more than just fun and games .
“If it weren’t for video game enthusiasts and the absolute commercial need to keep them happy with ever-better graphics requiring ever-higher processor speeds , complex computer graphics would still be found only in the high-priced domains of the business and science world , ” he said .
In an interview , Keith Feinstein , a video game historian , called Mr. Baer’s invention “the beginning of a revolution in thought . ”
Mr. Baer retired from Sanders in 1987 and started his own consulting business .
Mr. Baer is survived by two sons , James and Mark ; a daughter , Nancy Baer ; and four grandchildren .
His wife of 53 years , the former Dena Whinston , died in 2006 .
Mr. Baer donated his collection of early game hardware to several museums , including the Smithsonian Institution .

While the online home information space may be crowded , investors seem to believe that Redfin has a good chance of standing out .
Redfin , an online real estate brokerage , has raised $ 50 million in a new round of mezzanine capital , led by Tiger Global Management and T. Rowe Price .
Five existing investors , including Greylock Partners and DFJ Venture Capital , also participated .
It is the latest bet that Redfin , which combines home listings data with its own army of brokers , can shake up the traditional business of buying and selling property .
The company ’s approach differs from more prominent competitors like Zillow and Trulia , which focus more on being repositories of real estate information .
Redfin , which is 11 years old , now operates in 22 markets throughout the country , including <START:location> Boston <END> , <START:location> New York <END> , <START:location> Chicago <END> , <START:location> Miami <END> and its hometown of <START:location> Seattle <END> .
The chief executive of the company , Glenn Kelman , said in an interview that its approach was closer to that of the car service Uber or the home rental network Airbnb : connecting customers to tangible goods through Internet-based technology .
( By his own admission , the business is “very bizarre ” in that it is both a software company and a real estate brokerage . )
“It’s the idea that software companies can go into the real world and reinvent it , ” he said .
It’s an approach that took some time to build up steam .
In Redfin’s early days , executives had a hard time persuading would-be investors to take the risk of backing the company , Mr. Kelman  said .
“The business takes time to scale , which made early-stage investors wary , ” Mr. Kelman  said .
“ But Tiger and T. Rowe could see great scale here . ”
The company has grown significantly since its founding .
It is expected to be report positive earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization , as well as annual revenue growth of more than 50 percent .
Now with the additional financing , Redfin plans to invest more in technology development , potentially even at a pace that outstrips revenue growth .
And with the public markets welcoming technology darlings like Twitter , a public offering could be in the company ’s future .
During the fund-raising process for the most recent round , an investor asked Mr. Kelman  who would potentially buy Redfin .
According to James Slavet of Greylock , Mr. Kelman smiled and said “Nobody . ”
“There aren’t natural kinds of buyers , ” Mr. Slavet added .
“ I think ultimately Redfin can be a public company . ”
But Mr. Kelman  added that there was no pressure to go public soon , even as stock markets are soaring , pushing up company valuations .
Both Tiger and T. Rowe have indicated that they are not looking for an offering anytime soon , instead asking what Redfin plans to do to improve its customer service .
“ I don’t feel the pressure , ” he said .
“I’m not going to sell my shares in the company when the lockup ends .
It makes me less focused on the timing . ”

He keeps grade cards for every member of Congress , deploys three million activists to blast lawmakers with anti-immigration telephone calls , faxes and emails , and runs a website where his followers have called undocumented immigrants “criminal invaders ” and “wolves at the door . ”
But for Roy H. Beck , perhaps the most powerful member of the small but vocal movement that has helped scuttle every effort at an immigration overhaul for nearly two decades , the fight is only beginning .
Over the next year , his goal is to cut off funding for President Obama’s executive actions that have shielded up to five million people from deportation and will allow many of them work permits .
“There’s a good chance that we’ll roll back a good share of this , ” Mr. Beck , 66 , said in a recent interview in his <START:location> Rosslyn , Va. <END> , office , a mostly threadbare space with sweeping views of the <START:location> Potomac River <END> and the <START:location> Capitol <END> dome .
“We did as much as possible to make immigration radioactive in as many places as possible . ”
As the founder and president of NumbersUSA , Mr. Beck has 35 staff members and an annual budget of about $ 10 million compared with a coalition of immigrant groups that spent $ 1.5 billion from 2008 to 2012 lobbying for an array of immigration changes , according to an estimate by the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation .
But what Mr. Beck lacks in resources , he makes up for in impact .
Mr. Beck and his group “have succeeded in thwarting the passage of comprehensive immigration reform by generating popular anger on the right that overwhelmed mainstream Republicans , ” said Frank Sharry of America’s Voice , an advocacy group pressing for such an overhaul .
At the very least , immigration advocates say , they will have to fight the grass-roots uproar that Mr. Beck has fueled .
Mr. Beck , a former environmental journalist who once worked at The Grand Rapids Press and The Cincinnati Enquirer , said he did not feel the rage toward immigrants that he is able to marshal in others .
He said that he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 , and he is consistently described by his critics as genial and nonconfrontational .
But he says that the rise in immigration levels is destroying the <START:location> United States <END> — both the environment and employment opportunities for the working class — and is angry at what he considers complicity by the government on the immigrants ’ behalf .
While the country once admitted about 250,000 legal immigrants annually , he said , the number has ballooned to one million , which does not include those who come illegally .
Mr. Beck is pressing to cut legal immigration to 500,000 people a year .
“This has nothing to do with the immigrants themselves , ” Mr. Beck said .
“ But are the people who are here illegally more important than the Americans , the people of this national community , who have absolutely been robbed of their dignity ? ”
Despite his disclaimers , Mr. Beck’s critics say he is pushing a xenophobic agenda and is the benign face of a racist movement .
“ He’s played footsie with extremists all along , ” said Heidi Beirich , the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center ’s Intelligence Project , which tracks hate groups .
Even as she described Mr. Beck as a “completely nice guy , ” Ms. Beirich said that “in a way , what Beck does is , he provides cover for the bad guys . ”
The criticism stems from Mr. Beck’s connection to John H. Tanton , a <START:location> Michigan <END> ophthalmologist who helped start and finance NumbersUSA and has nurtured two other groups , the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Center for Immigration Studies , which share Mr. Beck’s commitment to reducing immigration .
Mr. Beck described him as “one of the grand environmental leaders , ” but Mr. Tanton has also been accused of pushing a white nationalist agenda , and he once wrote of his fear of a “Latino onslaught . ”
Mr. Beck said that his group had been independent of Mr. Tanton for a dozen years , and he went out of his way to deny charges of racism .
He has a “No to Immigrant Bashing ” section on the NumbersUSA website urging civil discourse , and said he filtered out user comments that contain overtly racist terms .
He has also posted a photograph of Barbara Jordan , a <START:location> Texas <END> congresswoman and civil rights leader who was the chairwoman of an immigration commission he advised in 1996 , doing so in part , Mr. Beck said , to ward off racist members .
“If you’re a white supremacy group , that ’s sort of a signal to you that , ‘This is not our group , ’ ” Mr. Beck said .
Tax disclosures filed in 2013 show that NumbersUSA received about $ 4.5 million from the Colcom Foundation , a Pittsburgh-based organization founded by Cordelia Scaife May , the Mellon banking heiress .
The foundation says it works to combat overpopulation ; the Southern Poverty Law Center says the foundation funds hate groups with “nativist ” missions .
The foundation’s vice president of philanthropy is John F. Rohe , a Tanton loyalist and biographer .
Numbers USA , Mr. Beck said , has “always stayed away from cultural issues . ”
From his earliest days , Mr. Beck focused on numbers .
Now the father of two adult sons , he was raised in <START:location> Marshfield <END> , a town of 2,500 in <START:location> Missouri’s Ozarks <END> , where he delivered milk and collected cans to make pocket money .
After journalism school at the University of Missouri , Mr. Beck became interested in immigration while covering the birth of the environmental movement in the late 1960s , as concern grew about the consequences of population growth on natural resources .
Disillusioned when he thought immigration was not receiving sufficient attention , he left journalism in the 1990s to write books , and later decided to start Numbers USA .
He began with a video , recorded on VHS tape in 1996 , in which he used a huge container of colored gumballs to illustrate the billions of people living in third world countries , and a small glass snifter to portray the <START:location> United States <END> , taking in millions more immigrants , one gumball at a time .
The gumballs are still in his office , but on a recent afternoon , he left them behind and instead took PowerPoint slides to make his arguments to a group of students from Grinnell College in <START:location> Iowa <END> who are spending a semester in <START:location> Washington <END> .
“At the end , unless somebody’s watching the numbers , you end up with a problem , ” Mr. Beck told the group .
“It sounds horrible , does n’t it ? ”
Mr. Beck conceded of his group ’s position that immigration should be sharply curtailed and strict new workplace screenings instituted , so any undocumented worker is immediately laid off .
“People say , ‘Boy that ’s really mean — it ’s so mean — because you’re making that person who has a job lose a job , ’ ” Mr. Beck told his young audience .
“And yet , as long as they’re in that job , what’s the meanest thing of all ?
The Americans that don’t have that job . ”

<START:location> SAN FRANCISCO <END> — As the annual Burning Man festival wrapped up over the holiday weekend , thousands of weary festivalgoers were somewhere in <START:location> Nevada <END> packing up yurts , washing off body paint and dreading their eventual re-entry to the real world .
Here , particularly in the city ’s rapidly gentrifying <START:location> Mission District <END> , their neighbors were dreading something else : the moment the “Burners ” come home .
Over the last few years , Burning Man — the mass camping trip/rave that participants have deemed indescribable to anyone who has n’t attended – - has become a veritable staycation for San Franciscans who don’t attend .
They say restaurants have more tables , parking spots are plentiful and yoga classes are extra chill .
Wednesday afternoon , the No. 1 story on Eater SF , a website about the local culinary scene , was titled “ <START:location> SF <END> Tables Worth Snagging During the Burning Man Exodus . ”
Allie Pape , the story ’s author , said the site did the same feature last year as well .
“My co-editor and I were joking about this is probably the week we should go to these ( restaurants ) .
And we were like ‘If we’re going to do this , why don’t we make a list ? ’
I have no scientific proof that reservations go down , but it ’s pop wisdom in <START:location> San Francisco <END> that anything is easier this week : The bars are less crowded , it ’s easier to park . ”
Sadly , it ’s not clear if there actually is scientific proof to support the Burning Man exodus .
The event is big – - it has attracted as many as 70,000 people – - but even if half of those came from <START:location> San Francisco <END> ( which seems unlikely ) , that would be a tiny portion of the city ’s 837,000 residents .
At The New York Times ’s request , data scientists from the reservation service OpenTable played with reams of <START:location> San Francisco <END> reservation data to see if there was a Burning Man lull , but could n’t find much .
But people in the <START:location> Mission <END> swear their neighborhood cleared out for the week .
The <START:location> Mission <END> is heavily populated with young tech workers .
On weekday mornings , fleets of private tech buses makes non-tech residents feel as if they live next to a high-end Greyhound station .
At 5 p.m. on Monday , Ben Thorne , owner of Sneaky’s BBQ , a catering service that does weekly ‘pop-ups ’ around <START:location> San Francisco <END> , parked right in front of the bar where he was serving his food that evening — a rare parking find that any Manhattanite could appreciate .
He spent the rest of the night dishing up Carolina-style pulled pork , ribs and chicken wings to an underwhelming number of people .
Jed Kolko , the chief economist for Trulia , a real estate site that is in the process of being acquired by Zillow , had just that kind of crowd in mind when he dropped by .
“A barbecue popup in a hip bar : I figured it would be empty this week , ” said Mr. Kolko .
“No wait for some of the best chicken wings I’ve ever had . ”
Business has also been slow at the Monk’s Kettle , a small but always-packed restaurant that specializes in craft beers .
It’s the sort of place that does n’t serve Budweiser but does serve a $ 15 burger that comes with “onion jam . ”
In normal times , even on weekdays , it routinely takes an hour to get a table at the Monk’s Kettle .
And seven nights a week , locals continue to drink hoppy , high-powered beers until bartenders cut them off and start flicking the lights .
But not last week .
The regular crowd of beer aficionados were gone , and in their place were tourists and newbies who were usually deterred by crowds .
“With Burning Man we kind of see a mass exodus of a lot of regulars from the <START:location> Mission <END> area and we’ll get a little bit of a lull , but then all of a sudden we have these people we’ve never seen .
Almost half the business we’ve had this week are people who have never been in before , ” said Adam Dulye , the chef/owner of the Monk’s Kettle and the nearby Abbot’s Cellar .
“People will walk into the bar and order a martini or a Manhattan and it ’s like ‘Uhh , we have beer . '”
Also unlike the regulars , they leave before the bar’s 2 a.m.
closing time .
“After 12:30 last night , the only two people in the restaurant were the people in the kitchen , the bartender , and the manager .
There was no one drinking a beer at 12:45 last night , ” said Mr. Dulye on Wednesday .
“We should do like a Burning Man beer that ’s not at Burning Man , just to drive business .
‘Did n’t go to Burning Man ? Come get this beer . ’”

The Senate Banking Committee plans to hold a hearing next week on ways to “protect the financial sector ” from cyberattacks , but for now there are no plans to have anyone from the financial services industry testify .
The hearing set for Wednesday will feature testimony from top officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the Secret Service , the Treasury Department , the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
The banking committee is holding the hearing in the aftermath of this summer ’s big cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase that compromised some account information of 83 million households and small businesses .
Law enforcement officials have said the same hackers that breached JPMorgan’s systems also tried to gain access to the systems of at least a dozen other financial institutions .
In October , the banking committee sent a letter to five regulators seeking information about how they were coordinating their work with law enforcement agencies in responding to attacks on the financial system .
They were also asked whether legislative proposals were needed to foster a better working relationship .
The letter specifically noted the attack on JPMorgan and the need to make sure that government agencies the private institutions work together to maintain the “integrity of the financial system . ”
A person briefed on the matter said the hearing would focus on how the various government agencies were working together to deal with cyberattacks on banks and other financial institutions .
It’s not clear how much of the testimony will discuss the attack on JPMorgan or any other specific financial institution .
Patricia Wexler , a JPMorgan spokeswoman , said the bank had not been asked to provide the committee with any information in advance of the hearing .
A spokeswoman for the <START:location> Connecticut <END> attorney general , George Jepsen , whose office is overseeing an investigation by several state attorneys generals into the JPMorgan breach , said the state office had not been contacted by the Senate committee .
In the JPMorgan attack , the bank has said it found no evidence of any fraud or misuse of customer information .
JPMorgan said the hackers got access only to customer email addresses , homes addresses and phone numbers but nothing of a more sensitive nature like Social Security numbers .
Over the past several years , cyberattacks on financial institutions have become a matter of increasing concern for regulators who are worried about criminals getting access to sensitive customer financial information or looting accounts .
To date , the most serious attacks have taken place in retail , with hackers attempting to get access to credit card account number by breaching the systems at companies like Target and Home Depot .

SINCE the feature first became available five years ago , the ability to deposit a check with a few taps on a smartphone has become one of the most popular features of mobile banking .
While the systems generally run smoothly , some possible drawbacks are becoming evident as use of the service grows .
Last year , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reported , about three-quarters of the largest banks offered mobile check deposit — known as “remote deposit capture ” in banking lingo .
The service , which lets customers use a mobile app to snap a photo of checks with their phones or tablets and deposit the money in their bank accounts , was used by about 11 percent of consumers a year ago , up from 2 percent in 2011 , according to a new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts .
As the service catches on , it becomes increasingly important for customers to compare the terms of mobile deposit services that different banks offer — but that comparison is n’t always easy to do , since disclosures by banks vary and are sometimes vague or incomplete , according to the Pew report .
“Consumers can’t readily comparison-shop based on terms and conditions , ” said Susan Weinstock , director of Pew’s consumer banking project .
Some banks , for instance , don’t offer immediate availability of funds deposited by smartphone , as a way to control fraud .
Banks also impose limits on the amounts that can be deposited using mobile phones , also to protect against fraud .
But it can be difficult to find that information ; some banks put such information online , rather than within the app that customers use to deposit the checks , Pew found .
While it ’s so far been relatively limited , fraud can occur with mobile check deposit , partly because unlike with traditional check deposits , the customer retains the original paper check , which can be redeposited — either by accident or intentionally .
A study by Celent of more than 200 banks found an uptick in fraud related to remote deposits as use of the service grows .
Each year from 2010 through 2012 , nearly 90 percent of banks said they had no losses attributable to remote deposit , but that proportion dropped to more than three-quarters of banks in 2013 .
So far , however , banks generally consider the losses that occur with mobile deposits to be “manageable , ” Bob Meara , a senior banking analyst at Celent , said .
That’s not to say that some consumers have n’t run into problems .
Katherine Kostreva , a marketing and public relations consultant in <START:location> New York <END> , said she had encountered problems with mobile check deposits at Bank of America this year — first for $ 1,400 and then for $ 1,200 .
In both cases , the bank concluded that the checks deposited with her mobile app were later deposited or cashed a second time at different banks .
As a result , Bank of America withdrew the funds that had been deposited in her account .
She said that she had been a victim of fraud , and that the paper checks deposited at the other banks were stolen from her .
She has been talking with the bank about the return of the money .
Here are some questions about mobile check deposit :
■ How should I sign my check when using mobile deposit ?
Check with your bank for its specific requirements .
In general , adding the phrase “for mobile deposit only ” is a good idea , said James DeBello , chief of Mitek , which provides the systems that process mobile check deposits at many banks .
That helps reduce the chance that someone could — intentionally or by accident — try to cash or redeposit the check .
Mitek now offers banks the ability to scan checks for the presence of such “restrictive endorsements , ” to reduce the risk of multiple deposits , Mr. DeBello said .
■ How long should I keep a paper check after I’ve deposited it using my phone ?
Each bank has its own rules , which may vary widely , the Pew report found .
Some banks require that the customer destroy the check as soon as the funds appear in the account ; other banks require checks to be held for up to 90 days , and at least one implies that checks should be held “indefinitely . ”
You should follow your bank’s rules , and keep the check in a safe place after you deposit it .
Al Pascual of Javelin Strategy & Research said that after depositing checks with mobile apps , consumers should treat them “like cash ” until their bank’s required holding period expires .
■ How soon after I deposit a check using my phone are funds available to me ?
The rules for availability of funds from mobile deposits may vary from those for checks deposited by traditional means , the Pew report found ; some banks offer immediate access to funds , but may charge a fee for the service .

In a twist on how <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> companies are financed , several technology luminaries have banded together to effectively do the work of a traditional venture capital firm .
The Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang , Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and others have invested $ 25 million in Change .org , the petitions website , to help it expand .
Others in the group include prominent business leaders like the billionaire Richard Branson , eBay founder Pierre M. Omidyar and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman .
In all , two dozen investors are contributing $ 250,000 to a few million dollars each .
“It would have been a lot more straightforward to raise money from a single institution , ” said Ben Rattray , Change .org’s
chief executive .
“ But we had a group of people who are passionate about our mission and who had experience building global enterprises , who we can turn to for advice . ”
Change .org lets users create online petitions that call on governments and companies to act on specific issues .
One recent campaign , begun after <START:location> Michael Brown <END> ’s death , calls for police in <START:location> St . Louis County <END> , the city of <START:location> St . Louis <END> and <START:location> Ferguson , Mo. <END> , where Mr. Brown was killed , to wear body cameras .
It quickly received more than 130,000 signatures .
Another campaign , started after Unilever sued a start-up food company that makes a mayonnaise alternative , called for big companies to “stop bullying sustainable food companies . ”
It garnered more than 100,000 supporters in less than a month .
Change .org had already raised nearly $ 20 million , most of it in a $ 15 million fund-raising round last year .
The new infusion of $ 25 million will be used to expand the company ’s engineering team , invest in mobile development and expand a tool that allows the businesses and politicians who are the targets of petitions to engage with users .
“We want a world where elected representatives can openly and authentically connect with their constituents at scale , ” Mr. Rattray said .
Among <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> start-ups , Change .org
has a reputation for being a progressive , mission-driven company .
Despite having a dot-org web suffix , it is a for-profit company .
But it is a benefit , or B , corporation , a distinction that allows it to make decisions based on what is good for society , not just what is good for its shareholders .
This year , for example , Change .org announced a generous new parental leave policy for its employees .
“B corps are different than traditional corporations in that they have higher standards of social and environmental performance , accountability and transparency , ” said Andrew Kassoy , a co-founder of B Lab , which certifies such companies .
Other start-ups including Etsy and Kickstarter are B corporations .
And divisions of some big public companies , like Ben & Jerry’s , which is owned by Unilever , have received the certification .
Change .org did not say how much investors estimated the company was worth with this latest round of financing .
Though many prominent start-ups have been pegged as being worth tens of billions of dollars , Mr. Rattray played down the importance of Silicon Valley companies chasing higher valuations .
“Some C.E.O.s become overly focused on building the valuation , instead of building the company , ” he said .
“We want the proxy for our success to be the victories of our campaigns . ”
More than 80 million people worldwide are using the site .
A majority of new users are from abroad .
This year , a petition to spare a Christian Sudanese woman from being executed attracted more than a million supporters .
The woman , Meriam Yehya Ibrahim , was freed this summer with help from the Italian and American governments .
The pooling of so many investors in Change .org’s
latest round recalls the angel investing model , in which investors typically put in much smaller amounts to finance fledgling companies , at a much large scale .
But it is unusual for a group of investors to commit so much money that funds from a traditional venture capital firm are unnecessary .
Last month , ZenPayroll , a <START:location> San Francisco <END> start-up , was among the few companies to do something similar , with more than 50 individual investors participating in its latest $ 20 million fund-raising round .
Mr. Rattray said having this prominent group of investors support Change .org would give him access to a network of advisers who could help guide the company as it continues to grow .
“These are people who recognize the power of the Internet , ” he said .
Others in the group include Sam Altman , the president of Y Combinator , the tech incubator company , and Michael Birch , co-founder of Bebo , a former social media site .
Because the money comes from individuals , not a venture capital firm with a specific time frame for getting a return on its investment , Change .org
will not be under pressure to go public or sell quickly , Mr. Rattray said .
“The reason we want mission aligned investors with long-term horizons is so we can focus on the product , ” he said .
Mr. Yang , the Yahoo co-founder , said he was not looking for a quick flip .
“Investing as an individual allows for a different time frame for an investment to mature , ” he wrote by email .
“For me , Change .org is a long-term investment that is aligned with the company ’s mission and its vision for continued growth as an independent business . ”
One repeat investor in the round is Omidyar Network , which represents Mr. Omidyar .
It had invested in Change .org ,
and supported the unique fund-raising approach .
“We wanted to see the organization broaden out its sponsorship and sources of capital ” with “individuals who look like institutions and can write meaningful checks , ” said Chris Bishko , an investment partner at Omidyar Network .
Mr. Bishko called Change .org “a global platform that is giving ordinary people a stronger voice on how things operate . ”
“This is an incredible innovation , and we’re just at the tip of the iceberg , ” he said .
But petitions are not all that Change .org
aspires to organize .
Mr. Rattray said he hoped it would also become a platform for organizing voting , fund-raising and more .
“Petitions are to Change .org as books were to Amazon , ” he said .

Rules , schmules .
As many people in <START:location> Portland , Ore. <END> , left work to return home on Friday evening , Uber , the ride-hailing start-up , began offering rides in that city for the first time , despite loud protests from local officials who have deemed the service illegal .
That devil-may-care approach to dealing with city officials — entering a city without permission and dealing with regulatory issues after its services are well established and locals are already hooked — has become a hallmark of Uber’s strategy .
In October , Uber began its service in <START:location> Las Vegas <END> , where it was deemed illegal ; multiple drivers were cited within hours of the company ’s debut there .
Similar scenarios played out in <START:location> Austin , Tex . <END> , <START:location> Philadelphia <END> and other cities around the country .
But Uber’s move in <START:location> Portland <END> comes just days after it vowed in a blog post to become a “ smarter and more humble company . ”
Uber , which is now valued at more than $ 40 billion , is reeling from a string of recent embarrassments that have critics questioning its ethics .
The company ’s executives have been accused of taking a lax approach to customer privacy , among other criticisms .
In <START:location> Portland <END> , the commissioner in charge of the city ’s Bureau of Transportation was furious enough at Uber that he suggested <START:location> Portland <END> should amend its regulations to allow Lyft — one of Uber’s biggest competitors — instead of Uber , to operate in the city .
On his Facebook page , the mayor threatened fines for the company and its drivers .
“People should know that Uber’s action is illegal , ” Mayor Charlie Hales said in the post .
“The city will enforce existing regulations .
That could include fines for the company , as well as fines for drivers . ”
Uber’s service , which allows users to summon a private car with a smartphone app , has become hugely popular in the five years since it was started .
The service has ballooned and now operates in more than 250 cities in 50 countries .
Uber’s arrival in <START:location> Portland <END> has been something of an inevitability .
The service has been available in more than a dozen cities surrounding the greater <START:location> Portland <END> area for months , and the company has been in talks with <START:location> Portland <END> .
“We’ve been talking to them for over a year , and we will continue to talk with them , ” said Eva Behrend , an Uber spokeswoman .
But <START:location> Portland <END> transportation officials have fought to examine current regulatory statutes before allowing the service to operate in the city .
Steve Novick , the commissioner of the Bureau of Transportation , said he learned of Uber’s intentions to set up shop earlier today when he received a text message from a reporter that said , “Uber tells me they’re launching at 5 , do you have anything to say ? ”
Not long after , Mr. Novick and Mr. Hales were on a conference call with Uber’s senior vice president for policy and strategy , David Plouffe , the former political strategist who ran President Obama’s 2008 campaign .
“Plouffe said , ‘ Well , you know we’re active in these markets and we’re providing a service and there is great demand in <START:location> Oregon <END> and blah blah blah , ’ ” Mr. Novick said .
“ I said , ‘Mr.
Plouffe , announcing that you’re going to break the law is not civil . ’
”
Mr. Novick added : “This is not about whether we should have a thoughtful conversation about changing taxi regulations — we’re up for that .
This is about one company thinking it is above the law . ”
If and when <START:location> Portland <END> amends its regulations to allow ride-sharing services like Uber , Mr. Novick said he wished there were some way for him to still prohibit Uber from coming to <START:location> Portland <END> .
“ I don’t know if this is legally feasible , but my inclination would be to allow Lyft here a long time before Uber , ” he said .
“Lyft seems like a respectable company , and Uber seems like a bunch of thugs . ”
But Uber does not show signs of slowing down .
“The statement by Commissioner Novick shows a real disregard for consumer demand , choice and what the people of <START:location> Portland <END> want , ” Ms. Behrend , the Uber spokeswoman , said .

The recidivism rate among companies caught violating securities laws can be a bit disheartening .
Despite settlements that include corporate proclamations of a commitment to compliance , the same names seem to appear again and again in settlements for new violations .
The Securities and Exchange Commission has recently taken a small step toward making the cost of a violation a bit steeper by refusing to give companies a free pass .
In August , Bank of America reached a $ 16.65 billion settlement with the Justice Department over accusations that it duped investors into buying troubled residential mortgage-backed securities .
As part of that settlement , the S.E.C. resolved charges of securities fraud .
That case was fairly small , requiring the bank to pay about $ 135 million for selling a security that resulted in heavy losses to investors .
But getting the settlement approved was held up until late last month because the S.E.C.’s commissioners could not agree on granting the bank a waiver from rules that could prevent it from selling certain investments .
That would have had a significant effect on its Merrill Lynch subsidiary by cutting off access to certain types of hedge fund investments , a lucrative segment of the market that would probably cost it clients .
S.E.C. Rule 506 permits sales of an unlimited amount of securities to “accredited investors , ” generally defined as those with the financial wherewithal to fend for themselves that do not need the protections provided by the disclosure requirements in the law .
This avenue is used annually to sell hundreds of billions of dollars in investments to large investors , like hedge funds and pension plans , and is a significant avenue for raising capital .
In the Dodd-Frank Act , Congress directed the S.E.C. to write a “bad actor” rule .
That rule does n’t allow the exemption if the issuer of the securities or its underwriters was subject to a judicial or administrative order for engaging in fraud or similar types of violations , like failing to maintain adequate books and records .
Adopted in 2013 as an amendment to Rule 506 , it imposes a five-year ban on participating in securities offerings unless the firm can convince the S.E.C. that there is good cause “that it is not necessary under the circumstances . ”
There is another “bad actor” rule important to large companies like Bank of America that routinely access the securities markets to raise capital .
Under Rule 405 , a “well-known seasoned issuer ” does not have to submit its offering documents in advance for review by the S.E.C. before selling securities , allowing it to act quickly when market conditions are favorable .
Like Rule 506 , this provision cannot be used by a company subject to an order prohibiting violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws as part of a settlement .
But it can be waived for “good cause . ”
Those waivers had become routine after a settlement with the S.E.C.
Some companies , in fact , received multiple waivers .
But last April , Kara M. Stein , one of the five commissioners , dissented from the order granting a waiver to the Royal Bank of Scotland after one of its subsidiaries pleaded guilty to manipulating the <START:location> London <END> interbank offered rate , or Libor .
In a statement , Ms. Stein warned that by routinely granting such waivers , the S.E.C. “may have enshrined a new policy — that some firms are just too big to bar . ”
That warning came to haunt Bank of America when it sought a waiver from the bad actor exclusion under Rule 506 after its mortgage-backed security settlement .
The bank was a victim of circumstances because Mary Jo White , the chairwoman of the S.E.C. , had to recuse herself from the case because of her prior representation of Kenneth D. Lewis , the bank’s former chief executive .
Bloomberg reported that the four remaining commissioners were split 2 to 2 on whether to grant a waiver , with Ms. Stein’s fellow Democratic commissioner , Luis A. Aguilar , joining her in holding up approval of the settlement until the waiver issue could be resolved .
The settlement was finally approved right before Thanksgiving when Bank of America agreed to appoint an outside monitor “not unacceptable ” to the S.E.C. to conduct a comprehensive review of its compliance with Rule 506 in exchange for a waiver of the bad actor ban .
Importantly , the waiver is only good for 30 months , so Bank of America will have to come back to the S.E.C. to show there is good cause for a waiver of the rest of the five-year prohibition .
The order also does not grant a waiver from the ban in Rule 405 on bad actors using the well-known seasoned issuer exemption .
Although it is likely that Bank of America will seek such a waiver in the future , for the moment , it will be a bit more difficult for the bank to quickly access the securities markets .
With settlements looming for big banks over their role in manipulation of foreign exchange rates , the question is whether the treatment of Bank of America will become the norm for obtaining waivers from the bad actor rules or whether the S.E.C. will revert to its earlier pattern of routinely granting those requests .
The circumstances requiring Bank of America to work hard for a waiver were unusual because Ms. White’s withdrawal from the case led to the even split between the remaining commissioners .
So it could be a one-time situation .
One issue that has divided the commission is whether to view the bad actor rules as another form of punishment for a violation , or as a remedy limited to violations that directly involve a company ’s financial reporting .
A Republican commissioner , Daniel M. Gallagher , issued a statement in April arguing that “the punishment-focused view ” of waivers of the well-known seasoned issuer rule “is even more troubling ” because the harm is inflicted on shareholders from the increased costs of issuing securities .
“We must have a robust waiver program to appropriately distinguish between cases when disqualification is and is not justified , ” he said .
In a speech on Dec. 4 , Ms. Stein celebrated the aggressive approach taken with Bank of America , stating that “we should be flexible and nuanced in our approach to these waivers , so that we make the most of this powerful tool . ”
She described the Bank of America order as “a breakthrough in the commission’s method of handling waivers , and I hope to see more of this and other thoughtful approaches in the future . ”
The terms of Bank of America’s waiver that require appointment of a monitor are not particularly onerous .
But they are a change from the days when granting such requests was almost a matter of routine .
No agency wants to be known as going soft on the companies it regulates , and the bad actor rules had become like sending a child to the time-out chair at home — a mild threat that was easily discarded once the appropriate apology was made .
The S.E.C. is likely to take a tougher stance in agreeing to waivers of the bad actor prohibition , which means defense lawyers will have to consider the waiver issue right from the start rather than assuming the agency will rubber-stamp requests .

Updated , 8:05 p.m. | For much of the last nine years , Zillow and Trulia have competed in the online real estate listings market they helped create .
But after a speedy six-week courtship , the two are set to combine forces .
Zillow agreed on Monday to buy Trulia for about $ 3.5 billion in stock , creating a giant online repository of real estate listings and home values .
Under the terms of the deal , Zillow will pay 0.444 of one of its shares for each share of Trulia .
Based on Friday ’s closing prices , the takeover bid is worth $ 70.53 a Trulia share , a premium of roughly 25 percent .
Together , the two will dominate the traffic for online home listings .
Last month , Zillow reported 83 million users , while Trulia reported 54 million — a combined 61 percent of total Internet users for the category , according to the research firm comScore .
“The companies know each other very well , ” Spencer Rascoff , Zillow’s chief executive , said in a telephone interview .
“We’ve been competitors and rivals for nine years , but I’ve always had respect for them . ”
Zillow has already become one of the best-known players in the market through its widely quoted “Zestimates ” of how much a property is worth , a feature particularly popular among homeowners .
Trulia , on the other hand , has tools that tend to draw more potential sellers and buyers .
According to Mr. Rascoff , that has meant relatively little overlap , with about half of Trulia’s web users not visiting Zillow .
Mr. Rascoff said he first approached Trulia about a potential acquisition about six weeks ago .
The initial response was not dismissive — though Trulia said that it had not intended to put itself up for sale — and management asked what Zillow had in mind .
“Both companies are coming at this from a lot of strength and momentum , ” Mr. Rascoff said .
“ When we approached them , I think they were both very open-minded about it . ”
Trulia’s management team , led by Pete Flint , ultimately proved willing to negotiate , but requested that it be an all-stock deal to give Trulia’s shareholders a chance to benefit from the merger .
( In the interest of keeping negotiations secret , both sides used code names : Zillow was “Zebra , ” while Trulia was “Tiger . ”
The password to access the electronic data room was “jungle .” )
Existing Trulia shareholders will own about a third of the combined company .
Mr. Flint will stay on and report to Mr. Rascoff , and he and another Trulia director will join Zillow’s board .
Together , the two companies expect to realize about $ 100 million in cost savings by 2016 .
The newly enlarged Zillow will offer more options for advertisers and for sellers and real estate agents to list home offerings , while combining the two companies ’ nascent rental search services .
Mr. Rascoff said he did not expect the merger to face opposition from antitrust regulators .
The revenue of the merged company — $ 341.2 million based on last year’s data — represents only a small part of the $ 12 billion he estimates the real estate industry spends on marketing each year .
Moreover , he argues , the real estate industry is highly fragmented , with scores of local sites for each city .
Both Zillow and Trulia have sought to combat that by making other acquisitions .
In the last year , Zillow bought both the New York-focused StreetEasy and the apartment search site HotPads , while Trulia bought Market Leader last spring for $ 310 million .
Zillow and Trulia will continue to compete until the deal closes , which is expected to happen sometime next year .
Zillow was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firms Shearman & Sterling and Perkins Coie .
Trulia was advised by JPMorgan Chase and Qatalyst Partners — the investment bank co-founded by Frank Quattrone — as well as the law firms Goodwin Procter and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati .
Zillow’s stock closed on Monday at $ 160.32 , up less than 1 percent .
Trulia shares closed at $ 65.04 , up 15.4 percent .

For years , <START:location> San Francisco <END> civic leaders have attempted to transform <START:location> Market Street <END> into a more vibrant and visitor-friendly corridor .
An ambitious LED light art project may now give that effort a big boost .
The thoroughfare is already undergoing much change as the technology industry has revitalized the local economy , decreasing commercial real estate vacancy rates .
The <START:location> mid-Market <END> area in particular has seen an infusion of investment attracted by the so-called Twitter tax break .
But an ambitious plan to string 124,000 LED lights , reflecting the movement of underground trains , overhead the 2.1 miles of <START:location> Market Street <END> from <START:location> The Embarcadero <END> to <START:location> Van Ness Avenue <END> may bring a different sort of transformation .
" <START:location> Market Street <END> already has its own form of momentum going , which is very much economic momentum right now , " said Ben Davis , founder of Illuminate the Arts , the art nonprofit proposing the project .
" I am really excited to bring this common thread of creativity and a reminder that this is not just a place of commerce , this is a place of community and a place of creativity and a place of culture . "
Davis added that the LightRail project would "help transform it from a place of hurried passage , in the evenings particularly , to a place of lingering destination . "
The lights will hang above the street and will track the passing Muni vehicles below ground .
The project has the support of the Board of Supervisors , which is expected to approve it today .
On Monday , the board 's land use committee supported the initiative .
Supervisor Scott Wiener , who called the project " the first of its kind in the world , " said <START:location> Market Street <END> deserves "improved treatment " and said the lights will build awareness about the ongoing A Better Market Street plan underway by city planners to overhaul the corridor .
" <START:location> Market Street <END> is a civic , cultural and transportation spine of <START:location> San Francisco <END> and is one of our most important streets , " Wiener said .
During an average weekday , more than 200,000 people walk along <START:location> Market Street <END> , where bicycles outnumber vehicles "at various times during the day , " according to the plan .
Illuminate the Arts was the group behind the $ 8 million Bay Lights project , which strung diode lights on the western span of the <START:location> Bay Bridge <END> .
The group recently received approval to make the artwork permanent if it is able to raise the $ 4 million to fund reinstallation of specially designed lights .
Davis said he intends to launch the LightRail artwork by the summer and will begin raising the multimillions of dollars it will require from private investors in January .
The timing may coincide with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Authority 's plan to possibly ban or restrict private vehicles along <START:location> Market Street <END> after experimenting with temporary restrictions this year .
Transit agency chief Ed Reiskin said at a Dec. 2 meeting that a traffic change proposal is expected to come in the spring for a summer implementation .

<START:location> SEOUL , South Korea <END> ( AP ) — <START:location> South Korea <END> 's transport ministry said Korean Air Lines Co. will face sanctions for pressuring employees to lie during a government probe into the nut rage fiasco that highlighted the tyrannical behavior of a top Korean business family .
The ministry said Tuesday it will also evaluate if the airline 's corporate culture poses safety risks after its chairman 's daughter Cho Hyun -ah overruled the captain of a flight to force the plane back to the gate in the incident early this month .
Cho , who was head of cabin service at Korean Air , ordered a senior flight attendant off a Dec. 5 flight after she was served macadamia nuts in a bag , instead of on a plate , in what she thought was a breach of service protocol in first class .
Transport ministry director Lee Gwang -hee said Korean Air could face 21 days of flight suspensions or a $ 1.3 million fine for violating aviation law .
The punishment will be determined by a separate committee that could decide to increase or lessen it .
Cho family members have a direct 10 percent stake in Korean Air , which is part of the family 's Hanjin conglomerate .
Park Chang-jin , the crew member who had to disembark from the plane , told <START:location> South Korea <END> 's KBS television network on Friday that Cho had shamed and insulted crew members .
A first-class passenger told Yonhap News Agency that Cho yelled at flight attendants who kneeled before her , pushed one flight attendant 's shoulder and threw an object at the cabin wall .
The incident now dubbed "nut rage " hogged headlines around the world and enraged the South Korean public , leading to Cho 's removal from all executive roles at the airline .
The 40-year-old and her father apologized last week , but a new furor has erupted over Korean Air 's attempt to foil government investigators and local media reports that exposed how Korean Air employees were treated like servants of the Cho family .
" If the incident itself were not beastly enough , Korean Air 's response has been abominable , " Korea Herald said in an editorial .
" In attempts that are akin to feudal servants trying to protect their lord 's daughter , Korean Air staff rallied to the rescue of Korean Air CEO Cho Yang-ho 's daughter . "
Park , the crew member , was visited by Korean Air Lines officials who pressured him to give a sanitized version of events to investigators .
The airline will be punished because Cho and Park lied during the probe and because the captain was negligent in his duties , according to the ministry .
However , the captain wo n't face any sanction as he was powerless to refuse a member of the family that controls the airline , said Lee , the transport official .
The ministry 's statement indicated other airline employees also faced pressure to lie to the investigators .
It did not identify them .
Its investigation found Cho used abusive language to flight attendants but could not ascertain if she used violence .
It will file a complaint against Cho with prosecutors later in the day .
Prosecutors earlier launched a separate investigation into the Korean Air case after receiving a complaint from a civic group .
Prosecutors summoned Cho to be questioned on Wednesday , according to Yonhap .
The incident also highlighted the risks of investing in family-controlled companies where the primary goal is to further the interests of the family , not that of the shareholders or employees .
Shares of Korean Air closed 0.3 percent lower after dropping nearly 6 percent in <START:location> Seoul <END> after the government announced its plan to sanction the airline .

On the eve of Google pulling the plug on Google News in <START:location> Spain <END> , the Spanish newspaper publishers who had pushed for a stringent new copyright law seem to be having second thoughts about irking the <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> tech giant .
Google has said it will shut down Google News in <START:location> Spain <END> on Tuesday and remove all Spanish publishers from its global news index .
The reason for the unprecedented move ( Google News has never pulled out of a country before ) is a new Spanish law taking effect Jan . 1 that would force the <START:location> U.S. <END> company and other news aggregators to pay Spanish publishers to display snippets of their news stories and link to them .
The Spanish Newspaper Publishers ’ Association , or AEDE , pushed for the copyright rules that lawmakers passed this fall .
But now the same newspaper lobby group tells The Spain Report that it wants the Spanish government or <START:location> European Union <END> to stop Google News from shutting down tomorrow “to protect the rights of citizens and businesses . ”
I spoke this weekend with Pipo Serrano , a journalist and professor at the University of Barcelona , who said a lot of Spaniards are likely to be upset at their government , but probably not at Google , when Google News begins blocking Spanish news tomorrow .
Readers will still be able to search for Spain-originated news stories on Google’s main search engine , just not Google News , which uses a different algorithm .
When it comes to the Internet , “the Spanish government does n’t know how to manage this , ” Serrano said .
“Instead of realizing we are in a new era , a new time , we’re trying to put patches on everything , trying to keep the old way working . ”
Google has described its 13-year-old Google News service as a “go-away ” site that helps news organizations by sending users directly to the original source of the news they are searching for .
It indexes content from 65,000 publishers in 30 languages , though the company will not say how many publishers and users it has in <START:location> Spain <END> .
“They’re not acting as vultures , picking up everything to enrich their business , ” Serrano said .
“The truth is that what Google does is just show the title , the abstract , then redirects people to the newspapers . ”
His perspective echoes what Richard Gingras , head of Google News , said in a statement last week announcing the shutdown .
“This new legislation requires every Spanish publication to charge services like Google News for showing even the smallest snippet from their publications , whether they want to or not , ” Gingras said .
“As Google News itself makes no money ( we do not show any advertising on the site ) this new approach is simply not sustainable . ”
Though nicknamed the “Google Tax ” because the new Spanish law targeted the giant <START:location> U.S. <END> search engine , the copyright changes also met opposition from homegrown tech entrepreneurs such as Ricardo Galli , founder of Spanish social news website Menéame .
Galli in recent days used Twitter to mock the publishing lobby and his country ’s conservative Popular Party for passing the law , and has previously threatened to move his business to another country .
Publishers in other Europeans countries have also fought for Google to pay them for linked content but none went as far as <START:location> Spain <END> .
Unlike in <START:location> Germany <END> , where most news organizations opted to stay on the Google News index even if the company did not pay them , the Spanish law would have barred Google from displaying news snippets and headlines even if the publications wanted the exposure without compensation .
Above : A man reads the front page of Spanish newspaper “El Pais ” on Thursday at a bar in <START:location> Pamplona <END> , in northern <START:location> Spain <END> .
Google announced Thursday it will close Google News in <START:location> Spain <END> and block reports from Spanish publishers from more than 70 Google News international editions due to a new Spanish law requiring aggregators to pay to link content .

A new project called CrowdSolve debuting on Indiegogo today asks the question : What happens if you use the “wisdom of the crowd ” to solve crime ?
It’s a marked contrast from the heroic image of the solitary detective , a la Batman or Sherlock Holmes , but one that might resonate more with our recent collective fascination with Serial , the ongoing podcast spun out of This American Life documenting the murder of a <START:location> Baltimore <END> woman and the conviction of her accused killer .
Serial’s story arc includes a murder , the subsequent investigation and a conviction , but it has still resulted in a veritable legion of amateur detectives who collectively pore over and obsess about the details of the case , gathering on Reddit and other platforms and working together to potentially uncover new evidence and propose alternate theories of what really happened .
CrowdSolve’s founder Colin Helibut wonders whether the same intense focus could be leveraged to help the roughly 50,000 to 120,000 wrongfully convicted people in prison in the U.S. right now (using study estimates of 2.5 percent to 5 percent in jail currently wrongfully convicted , with U.S. prison population of 2.4 million ) .
CrowdSolve’s goal with Indiegogo is to raise $ 50,000 to help pay the government and administrative fees associated with accessing public case files and other documents , and to build visualization tools that will allow the community to better make sense of their data .
The community will include moderation , and an up/downvoting system similar to Reddit to help make sure things stay on track and the best information rises to the top , and participants will build cases and theories that they can then hand off to others , or work on collaboratively and have vetted by the community .
Of course , everything about this idea should be setting off alarm bells in your head right now – the crowd’s “wisdom” is not always best defined as such , after all .
Reddit has demonstrated the weakness of the concept of crowd-sourced investigation by mis-identifying suspects in the past , including the Boston Marathon bomber .
Helibut tells TechCrunch that the idea behind CrowdSolve is actually to counter some of Reddit’s inherent weakness when it comes to crowdsourced crime fighting .
“Reddit is a wonderful and hugely important community , but at its core , it ’s purpose is general conversation and news aggregation , ” he said .
“Their basic setup and infrastructure is not well-suited to data-organization , citation , annotation , etc .
On the other hand , CrowdSolve is being built from the ground-up to foster the exploration and exposition of criminal investigations in a transparent , tightly monitored way . ”
Helibut also answers concerns about the weakness of the model by pointing to the sacrifices made in doing nothing : The Innocence Project and others devoted to reversing wrongful convictions have limited resources , he points out , and there are precious few alternatives that can scale to properly address the problem .
It’s true that if CrowdSolve can actually help reverse wrongful convictions , it will have a social impact that ’s hard to overvalue , but there’s a very good reason investigators often refrain from sharing case details with the public early on – groups can make mistakes just as easily as individuals , and the ramifications of making erroneous assumptions in the public sphere is often far more devastating than making them behind closed doors .
Even with so-called “cold cases , ” amateur investigations have the potential to upend lives , including those of innocent people close to the case .
Data , analytical tools and moderation might be the key to regulating a process that could easily spiral dangerously out of control , but there’s little evidence yet to suggest using the distributed processing approach to solving crime will have the same impact to social good that crowdsourced gene sequencing has had to science : the former involves a lot more reliance on the fragile and changeable beast that is human judgement , and that ’s a powder keg ready just waiting for a match .

Amazon just made good on its promise .
HBO GO is now available on the Amazon Fire TV and will hit the Fire TV Stick this coming spring .
Best yet , the app fully supports Amazon’s impressive voice search that let’s users find content with a button built into the Fire TV remote .
When the Fire TV launched , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos promised that the streamer would get HBO GO by the end of the year .
And with just two weeks go in 2014 , Amazon just made the cut .
“Since launch we’ve increased the number of services available on Amazon Fire TV by more than 4x , ” said Peter Larsen , Vice President Amazon Devices , said in a released statement .
“We’re thrilled to add HBO GO , the most requested service , to Fire TV in time for the holidays .
HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking and award-winning TV shows and movies , and we are excited to bring this amazing content to our customers , all of which is accessible via voice search on your Fire TV remote . ”
Amazon had previously cut a deal with HBO that brought a large chunk of HBO’s back catalog to Amazon Prime Instant Video and the Fire TV devices .
Yet new content from new series like Game of Thrones , The Newsroom and Girls were missing .
The addition of this app sort of solves that problem ; an HBO subscription is still required to view the content .

Hiptic Games , a Y Combinator alum that ’s been operating in stealth since the summer 2011 batch , has launched GameThrive , a push notification service that aims to help developers engage players when they’re least likely to be annoyed .
Originally built for the team’s own needs , the service combines push-notification delivery automation with analytics tools to avoid overwhelming users to the point where they delete an app .
Looking at things like playing habits and response rates to different notifications , the service schedules messages for in-game deals or events at times when players will be mostly likely to engage with them and come back to the game .
GameThrive is available as a native SDK for iOS , Android , and Windows Phone , but most developers will probably find it easier to build into games using SDKs for popular engines .
With the exception of Unreal , there are kits available for most major mobile engines including Unity and Cocos2d-x .
Corona and Marmalade have actually partnered with Hiptic to make it available directly to developers who download their engines without requiring a separate add-on .
Hiptic CEO George Deglin says that most of the 900 developers using the service have been grandfathered in on special beta pricing plans and don’t have to pay until they’re delivering notifications to 8 million devices .
Those signing up now won’t pay if they’re reaching fewer than 1 million devices , with plans starting at $ 49 per month for user bases bigger than that .
As mentioned in the blog post announcing the service’s launch , Hiptic hopes to bring over developers who rely on Urban Airship’s free notification tier , which ends at the end of this month .
They’ve built a tool that automates migrating over from that service using just your credentials .

Homejoy , the <START:location> U.S. <END> domestic cleaning startup that ’s backed by the likes of Google Ventures to the tune of $ 38 million , is putting another of its international operations on hold .
Following news earlier today that its Canada-based business is being “paused” , TechCrunch has learned that Homejoy’s activities in <START:location> France <END> have been met with the same fate .
A spokesperson told me that what this means in practice is that the company is no longer accepting bookings in France , while — in a line similar to the one given regarding <START:location> Canada <END> — it ’s maintaining relationships with the cleaners locally who were signed up to its platform , for when ( or if ? ) Homejoy re-enters <START:location> France <END> .
Relationships , of course , can’t be put on hold forever , and it would seem inevitable that those cleaners will now be looking for work elsewhere .
Meanwhile , the company is keen to stress that it remains active in <START:location> Europe <END> — specifically , that it is choosing to focus on <START:location> Germany <END> , where <START:location> Berlin <END> will now act as its European customer service “hub” , and the <START:location> UK <END> where it currently has operations in <START:location> London <END> .
It’s also recently added <START:location> Munich <END> to its German presence , which also includes <START:location> Hamburg <END> .
What’s interesting about Homejoy’s “pausing ” of operations in <START:location> Canada <END> and <START:location> France <END> is that it recently saw a new and potentially formidable competitor in the form of Rocket Internet’s Helpling , which has recently launched its domestic cleaning service in both countries .
<START:location> Paris <END> in particular looks to be heating up as a battleground .
Alongside Helpling , there’s UK-headquartered and Accel-backed Hassle , which actually expanded to the French capital city before the Rocket Internet startup made its way across the border .
Both companies will probably be glad to see the back of Homejoy , at least for now .
You know what they say , if you can’t stand the heat …

Hang with startup kids long enough , and you’ll notice that they have their own language .
No, bro , it ’s a SaaS play in the on-demand food space .
Think of it as the Uber for gluten-free Whole Foods delivery , ok ?
It never ends : We’re actively raising , but really want to make sure that we hit investor-board fit before product-market sync , you know ?
This can be confusing .
However , TechCrunch is here to demystify startup lingo into a more common lingua franca .
The startup kids , after all , are worth trying to understand .
One or two of them might even build something usable .
So , without further ado , I give you How To Speak Startup :
Acqui-hire – A strategy for acquiring talent pioneered by Google in the mid-2000s that happens when a bigger company thinks your team is good but your idea is hilariously bad .
Also called a “signing bonus . ”
Failure – A bad thing that the Silly Valley has recently put on a pedestal as something to be celebrated .
Cashflow Positive – Someone gave us a dollar .
Pivot – What happens when a company realizes their course of action is not living up to expectations .
The classic historic example is The Point , which became Groupon after the company posted a coupon to a pizza place in The Point’s building in <START:location> Chicago <END> .
( See also , Failure . )
SaaS — It loses money .
Pre-Money Valuation – A number you made up .
Post-Money Valuation – A number that you made up alongside your VC with the addition of some cash .
Your burn rate is probably too high .
“ I work in PR.” – I am , in fact , in possession of several journalists ’ email addresses .
Exit – Exits come in two different flavors for entrepreneurs : good and bad .
Good exits happen when you’re “killing it” , your company has n’t killed you yet , and another company comes along to buy yours .
( See possibly , acqui-hire . )
Bad exits are another way of saying you failed to disrupt much of anything besides your VC’s portfolio performance .
“I’m a serial entrepreneur . ”
– Person who had two ideas , both of which failed .
The Space – Because calling the field in which they’re operating an industry , vertical or even genre is too hard , entrepreneurs like referring to their company as being a player in a given space .
They especially like doing this when they know they’re in a crowded market .
We don’t know why they do this either .
VC – 1 ) Venture capitalists raise money from wealthy individuals and institutions and dump lots of said money into young companies in exchange for a cut of the company .
2 ) An institutional dealer of pharmaceutical-grade Opium .
( See also , Opium . )
Opium – OPM , or “other people’s money” , is an incredibly addictive substance to entrepreneurs that ’s rarely respected or missed until it dries up .
“We’re doing great . ”
– We are not doing great .
SF / The Valley – A place that VC’s and tech luminaries talk up as the greatest place on Earth that you must move to if you’re from anywhere that is n’t <START:location> SF <END> or <START:location> The Valley <END> .
“We’re growing 500 percent week-over-week ” — Last week we had one user , today we have six .
“We’re not currently raising . ”
— We’re currently raising .
UI/UX – A portmanteau of UI ( “User Interface” ) and UX ( “User Experience” ) often used by design-challenged entrepreneurs when referring to the aesthetics and usability of their product when actual understanding of good design principles is fundamentally lacking .
Used in a sentence : “Our Push for Pizza for Nickelodeon VHS tapes app is crushing it because of our design wizard is slinging some hella dope UI/UX.”
“We’re a design-centric organization . ”
– We don’t know how to code .
Non-GAAP Profitable — What companies that are very unprofitable like to claim .
The idea that non-cash costs don’t count is usually the sort of sickness you see here .
“I’m the business guy . ”
– ( See : Free-rider problem , Growth Hacker . )
Gravity — We don’t have that in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> .
$ 32 Million Series A Round – Something that is doomed to failure .
Growth Hacking – Sales , marketing and associated activities , but with a label that incorporates the word “hacking , ” because nontechnical people want to call themselves “hackers ” too .
“We’re seeing great gross margins , and so are investing in growth given our strong , SaaS unit-economics . ”
— We lose money .
“We’re stomping on the gas pedal , given our strong SaaS unit-economics , and are actively seeking additional capital to power our sector-leading growth . ”
— We have lost all our money and need some of yours , please .
“We’re Crushing It ! ” – Your dreams and investors ’ dollars are probably being crushed .
First rule of Fight Club , bro .
We hope this helps .

Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook profile has come under attack from a large number of online trolls who are taking advantage of the opportunity to leave comments , including stickers , photos and other “meme” images , on the Facebook CEO’s public posts .
The attackers are largely based in <START:location> Brazil <END> , and their barrage of comments and jokes have continued for several days now , nonstop .
We’ve heard some reports , via tipsters , that the attack started as some kind of protest against the low reach of Facebook Pages , but that remains unclear .
The messages and comments currently visible don’t speak to any specific agenda or complaint against Facebook or its founder , but rather seem to be random , and sometimes bizarre , posts typical to spam attacks instigated by trolls .
The trolling is taking place on older posts which are further back on Mark Zuckerberg’s Timeline .
It appears the attacks began in the comments section of a post in May 2012 where Zuckerberg added a “life event ” announcing his marriage to Priscilla Chan .
There are now nearly 2 million Likes on that image and 186,400+ comments , most of which are now nonsensical photos and memes , stickers and other random comments .
Few commenters are leaving any text comments of their own .
Another post – this one where Zuckerberg announced he became a vegetarian in January 2011 – is also seeing massive abuse , with now over 108,000 comments .
Some of the commenters have even begun leaving images that say things like ( roughly translated ) , “this trolling is out of control . ”
Many also just say “come join the ‘zueira , '” which basically means trolling or disorder .
“Trolling today , trolling tomorrow , trolling forever ” reads one .
“Go go go zoeira” proclaims another .
While it ’s unknown at this time who started the trolling or why , one link in a news article pointed to this Facebook group titled “Flood that Mark ” ( translation via Google Translate ) .
The group currently has 1,153 members and instructs them , in Portuguese , to participate in challenges and reminds them “what happens in the group , stays in the group . ”
The group ’s banner image include photos of Zuckerberg , his wife and an image that is regularly seen in the trolls ’ Facebook comments .
One commenter on a Brazilian news site said the group would not stop until it reached a record number of comments .
We’ve asked Facebook if it was aware of the abuse , and what , if any , actions it ’s planning to take to stem the flood of comments .
We’ll update if Facebook responds .

Your house is cold , but your thermostat is way over there .
You could walk over to your thermostat and crank the heat , but pfft , walking .
If you have a Nest , you could open up the app and control it that way , but , pfft , opening apps by hand .
What is this , 2007 ? !
As of this morning , you can now control a Nest with your voice .
Making use of that $ 3.2 billion acquisition it made earlier this year , Google is integrating Nest functionality into Google Now .
Want to make it warmer ?
Just say “Ok Google , change temperature to 75 degrees . ”
to your phone .
Meanwhile , Google Now will also throw up a card whenever Nest’s automated control settings kick in .
If it decides to bump the temperature up on its own to prep for your arrival from work , for example , it’ll show up as a Now card .
A few things to note :
Okay , Google .
Now teach my house to respond to “Tea , Earl Grey , Hot . ”

Are you ready to amp up your acoustic guitar to the MAXXXX ?
The ToneWoodAmp has got you covered .
This surprisingly cool Kickstarter project is essentially a speaker that takes the sound coming in from your acoustic guitar , modifies it , and then reproduces it automatically so you can hear it out of the guitar body .
It’s great for folks who might not have access to effects pedals or a PA system and for buskers or live players who are looking for an interesting way to modify a standard guitar .
The amp connects to the back of your guitar and the sound reverberates through the body .
It has a number of inbuilt effects including tremolo an reverb and you can even run the sound through an iOS device to use software filters and effects .
The amp costs $ 110 for early bird backers and will eventually retail for $ 199 .
The team has working prototypes so far and it looks like it ’s going to ship in June .
While most guitarists already have a bank of pedals and effects they use , having this attached to an acoustic guitar seems like an interesting solution for gear heads .
The kit connects to your guitar using magnetic rails that are mounted inside the guitar .
This means it can be removed as necessary and won’t destroy the outside of your guitar .
As TechCrunch’s resident SHRED MAETERXXXTOTHEMAXXX I’m actually curious how this sounds and how it works outdoors .
Who knows , the next busker you meet may be able to truly SHRED a little Stairway next to the Cold Stone using electronic effects and an old Fender .

The hostage situation in <START:location> Sydney’s <END> busy city district has crossed over into day two , with the identity of the hostage taker revealed as Man Haron Monis .
The perpetrator , 49 , is a self-proclaimed sheikh already pending trial and out on bail for being an accessory to murder .
He still has an unconfirmed number of hostages captured inside a Lindt Cafe in <START:location> Sydney <END> .
Some hostages escaped or were otherwise freed , and police have now stormed the cafe , according to the NYT .
TechCrunch is n’t the place for breaking news on the situation , which can be found here and here .
But as the world watches <START:location> Sydney <END> , we noticed a specific , and now-viral , status update from Jason Maggs .
It has now been shared more than 16,000 times on Facebook , noted by FBNewswire , and we’re simply hoping to pass the powerful message along .
He wrote :
Jason’s status update is just a small part of Australia’s social media reaction .
The hashtag # IWillRideWithYou is growing in <START:location> Australia <END> , with more than 100k shares across Facebook and Twitter .
The hashtag is meant to express solidarity among Australians as they use public transport , encouraging those religiously dressed to feel safe and those who are not , to feel safe around them .
It was reportedly started by a girl named Rachael , who recounted an experience on a public train the morning that the hostage crisis began .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the hostages , their families , and anyone victimized or involved in the situation .
And also , we agree with Jason .

“No one’s private life can totally withstand public scrutiny , ” reads an NYT op-ed penned by screenwriter and playwright Aaron Sorkin , angrily blasting the media for reporting the private details revealed through the recent hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment , in what’s shaping up to be one of the largest corporate data breaches to date .
“…Every news outlet that did the bidding of the [hacking group ] Guardians of Peace is morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable , ” he adds .
Meanwhile , Sony Pictures – blithely ignoring the First Amendment ( and the Streisand effect ) – has threatened legal action against journalists reporting on the findings from the stolen documents .
Sorkin and Sony are both wrong .
Sony may be a victim , but there is data in the breach that ’s worth reporting to the public – even if one of the largest takeaways is for other corporations to react to Sony ’s cautionary tale and beef up its own servers and security infrastructure .
Sony Tries Silencing Reporters
One thing the world needs to understand immediately is that all information is public by default , and the only real privacy protection is that its exposure has yet to be targeted by determined hackers .
Over the past several years , hackers have stolen consumers ’ personal information and credit card numbers from some of the largest retailers .
They’ve pulled nude photos off celebrity’s phones and from “private” messaging app Snapchat .
Large companies like Adobe and eBay have seen emails and other personal account information stolen .
And whistleblowers like Snowden have revealed the most private and devastating aspects of government spying agendas .
There is literally nothing that is above being exposed publicly if the right people are focused on a specific agenda .
The Sony hack was carried out by a group referring to itself as the “Guardians of Peace . ”
The group has demanded that Sony pull its upcoming movie “The Interview , ” starring Seth Rogen and James Franco , which was based on a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un .
The group has leaked a number of Sony movies online including the yet-to-be released remake of “Annie , ” plus “Mr.
Turner , ” “Still Alice , ” and “To Write Love on Her Arms , ” alongside large data dumps from inside Sony ’s corporate network .
The reaction , however , of hacking victims like Sony should not include tantrums like those now demonstrated by Sorkin and the studio itself .
They should only offer apologies , if they say anything at all .
Apologies for making the hack just so damned easy , keeping some of the company ’s most private information on its operations , its employees ( and their families ) in unencrypted Excel and Word files and carelessly shared emails .
That’s not to blame the victims themselves , though – individuals make mistakes , but corporate IT policies are meant to protect those mistakes from becoming publicly shared data .
Sony Pictures , one of the <START:location> U.S. <END> ’s largest studios , has now , somewhat ridiculously , asked journalists to destroy the stolen documents , and warned that those who did n’t comply will face further action , the company threatened via letters sent to a number of online and print publishers .
“Sony Pictures Entertainment will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss arising from such use or dissemination by you , ” the letter states .
News media has reported on a number of these leaked emails , which have included private jabs , jokes and commentary , including a director referring to <START:location> Hollywood <END> star Angelina Jolie as a “spoiled brat , ” Sony ’s botching of the Steve Jobs movie , and racist riffs between studio co-chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin about what President Obama’s favorite movies might be .
One could argue that those sorts of details , as Sorkin claims , were exploited for pageviews more so than public good .
But that ’s not looking at the bigger picture related to the media’s coverage of the hack .
Beyond providing fodder for gossip blogs , the Sony hack has also revealed serious information that ’s arguably more serving of the “public interest . ”
( Hint : that ’s what journalists are supposed to cover – a topic , incidentally , that Sorkin’s own show HBO’s “The Newsroom” has grappled with recently , when its reporters for a fictional news network resembling CNN landed a treasure trove of stolen Department of Defense documents . )
Worth Revealing ?
The Sony hack has displayed a lot about the failing of our modern , wired corporate culture .
Like just how casual internal company HR employees treat email communication , for example .
Email is not private ; as a former IT worker , I could have accessed any inbox on my domain ( and often did , though not for reading emails , but for legitimate reasons like backup , archiving , or transfer to a new hire ) .
But more importantly , employees dealing with sensitive information seem not to understand that email is not a place where an HR employee needs to be detailing a child’s medical treatment , where that treatment is taking place , the child’s name , how the child was doing in treatment , and more .
Sony , and likely other organizations that are currently fortunate enough to not have their poor security policies exposed , also does not seem to understand that if you’re choosing to record Social Security numbers , birth dates and salaries in Excel spreadsheets , you should protect them with at least a minimum amount of security , by way of encryption .
Or hell , even a password .
( That’s not to say the files could n’t have still been hacked , but it would have made it that much harder . )
In addition , while the hackers may have accessed the files in question illegally , there are insights the files reveal that are worth sharing more broadly .
It’s worth informing the public that the studio’s upper management is 94 percent male , and 88 percent white ( as Fusion reports ) – making them less diverse than the much-lambasted tech companies whose recent barrage of diversity reports have revealed their tendencies toward monoculture , for instance .

Another key item that was revealed by journalists reporting on the Sony leak was that of Hollywood’s war against Google , which was code-named “Project Goliath ” in email threads .
As detailed by The Verge , lawyers from the MPAA and half a dozen major studios refer to “Goliath ” as their biggest enemy in their battle with online piracy , and the Sony emails discuss a variety of tactics to fight “Goliath , ” including site blocking , legal action involving state attorneys general , political lobbying , and more .
Sony ’s Emails Could Be Your Emails
Sorkin ( and Sony ) are fine to criticize reporters ’ editorial choices .
But Sorkin , in a nutshell , is wrong to say that reporting on the leaks is “spectacularly dishonorable ” as a whole .
And neither is he correct in thinking that the right to report should be shut down .
These leaks have contained thousands of Social Security numbers , personnel files containing employee salaries and severance costs , personal information on employees and execs including birth dates , and even health records for dozens of employees , their spouses and their children .
The press is not generally pointing to the actual files in question , hosting them on their own sites in full , or revealing details like which employees had high medical bills , or which child’s medical claims were being denied .
The media has reported , however , that is the kind of information these documents contain .
And it ’s worth doing so : Sony ’s emails could be your emails .
They could be your company ’s emails .
Those could be your kids .
If an organization of Sony ’s size is susceptible to hacking , anyone is .
In the aftermath , Sony has now hired FireEye Inc. ’s Mandiant forensics unit to clean up this massive cyber attack , as the FBI investigates the incident .
But the immediate damage has been done and the damage may continue for some time .
Only a small number of documents have been revealed so far – the hackers reportedly captured over 100 terabytes of data .
Headlines about <START:location> Hollywood <END> actors or ego-damaging asides may draw pageviews ( and may be in poor taste ) , but what’s not up for debate is whether journalists can report on illegally obtained files – they can , thanks to First Amendment protections .
Is there anything in the files that “can help , inform or protect anyone ? , ” asks Sorkin , mid-tirade .
Yes , as our above examples show .
But also , more generally , that this happened , that this level of private data can be revealed , and that it can be revealed with ease can help us all .
Let it serve as a warning to everyone from corporate IT to everyday consumers to protect ourselves…or risk becoming the next Sony .

<START:location> GULFPORT , Miss <END> .
— In June , NASA finished work on a huge construction project here in <START:location> Mississippi <END> : a $ 349 million laboratory tower , designed to test a new rocket engine in a chamber that mimicked the vacuum of space .
Then , NASA did something odd .
As soon as the work was done , it shut the tower down .
The project was officially “mothballed ” — closed up and left empty — without ever being used .
Sixth in a series examining the failures at the heart of troubled federal systems .
Above : The A-3 test stand , shown under construction at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in <START:location> Mississippi <END> , was built for a rocket program that was canceled .
( NASA )
“You lock the door , so nobody gets in and hurts themselves , ” said Daniel Dumbacher , a former NASA official who oversaw the project .
The reason for the shutdown : The new tower — called the A-3 test stand — was useless .
Just as expected .
The rocket program it was designed for had been canceled in 2010 .
But , at first , cautious NASA bureaucrats did n’t want to stop the construction on their own authority .
And then Congress — at the urging of a senator from <START:location> Mississippi <END> — swooped in and ordered the agency to finish the tower , no matter what .
The result was that NASA spent four more years building something it did n’t need .
Now , the agency will spend about $ 700,000 a year to maintain it in disuse .
The empty tower in <START:location> Mississippi <END> is evidence of a breakdown at NASA , which used to be a glorious symbol of what an American bureaucracy could achieve .
In the Space Race days of the 1960s , the agency was given a clear , galvanizing mission : reach the moon within the decade .
In less than seven , NASA got it done .
Now , NASA has become a symbol of something else : what happens to a big bureaucracy after its sense of mission starts to fade .
In the past few years , presidents have repeatedly scrubbed and rewritten NASA’s goals .
The moon was in .
The moon was out .
Mars was in .
Now , Mars looks like a stretch .
Today , the first goal is to visit an asteroid .
Jerked from one mission to another , NASA lost its sense that any mission was truly urgent .
It began to absorb the vices of less-glamorous bureaucracies : Officials tended to let projects run over time and budget .
Its congressional overseers tended to view NASA first as a means to deliver pork back home , and second as a means to deliver Americans into space .
In <START:location> Mississippi <END> , NASA built a monument to its own institutional drift .
The useless tower was repeatedly approved by people who , in essence , argued that the American space program had nothing better to do .
“ What the hell are they doing ?
I mean , that ’s a lot of people’s hard-earned money , ” said David Forshee , who spent 18 months as the general foreman for the pipefitters who helped build the tower .
Like other workmen , he had taken pride in this massive , complicated project — only to learn that it was in mothballs .
“It’s heartbreaking to know that , you know , you thought you’d done something good , ” Forshee said .
“And all you ’ve done is go around in a damn circle , like a dog chasing his tail . ”
“It’s heartbreaking to know that ... you thought you’d done something good , ” said David Forshee , who spent 18 months as the general foreman for the pipefitters who helped build the tower .
“And all you ’ve done is go around in a damn circle , like a dog chasing his tail . ”
( William Widmer for <START:location> The Washington Post <END> )
Seven years ago , when the tower still seemed like a useful idea , the governor came to the groundbreaking .
So did a congressman .
Two senators .
On a hot morning in August 2007 , next to a canal full of alligators , somebody laid down AstroTurf and clean dirt over the sandy <START:location> Mississippi <END> soil .
The dignitaries stood on the fake grass .
They stuck gold-painted shovels into the fake earth .
They said they were starting one of the greatest journeys in human history .
Right here — at a 30-story tower rising out of the woods — NASA would test the rockets that would take Americans back to the moon .
And then even farther , on to Mars .
“You who live in <START:location> Mississippi <END> and who work at this space center will see that frontier opening , ” said Shana Dale , who was then NASA’s second-in-command .
“You’ll hear it , too : the rumble of moon-bound rockets being tested here .
The thunder of possibility ; the roar of freedom . ”
This tower was intended to test a rocket engine called the J-2X .
The plan was for a spacecraft to carry this engine , un-lit , up out of the Earth’s atmosphere .
Then the engine would ignite and propel the spacecraft toward the moon .
But , before NASA stuck an astronaut on top of that idea , it wanted to test the engine .
In the near-vacuum at the edge of space , would the whole thing vibrate , crack or blow apart ?
There was only one way to know .
“You have to fake the vacuum , ” said Dumbacher , the former NASA official .
To do that , NASA had to create a giant pressure cooker on stilts .
Workers would build a sealed metal container , big enough to hold a school bus .
Then they would install it in the middle of a 300-foot-tall steel tower , reinforced to resist 1 million pounds of upward thrust from a rocket .
Then , they would put the rocket engine in the container .
Seal the door .
Suck out the air .
And light the fire .
At the very beginning , NASA projected that the tower would cost $ 119 million .
It was supposed to be finished by late 2010 .
Back in <START:location> Washington <END> , it was n’t long after the groundbreaking that NASA officials began to hear about problems with the project .
For one thing , the estimated cost increased to $ 163 million .
To $ 185 million .
Then beyond that .
NASA’s inspector general said the main contractor , Jacobs Engineering Group , blamed changes in the design , plus unforeseen increases in the cost of labor and steel .
NASA paid the higher price .
The builders kept building .
“ I don’t think the contractors were attempting a scam .
I think , in all honesty , that they did not understand the magnitude of the job , ” said one former senior NASA official who was familiar with the project .
“ I know people involved as human beings .
I do not think they were trying to take advantage ” of NASA , the former official said .
Jacobs declined to comment .
At NASA , as at other large government agencies , this was an old institutional vice : making a big purchase , then letting the cost get bigger and bigger .
Studies had found that when NASA projects ran way late or way over budget , the agency rarely took the hard step of killing them .
Earlier this year , the Post examined five other cases where old , stubborn problems were causing federal bureaucracies to waste time and money .
Here 's what happened at those places after the Post wrote about their breaking points .
“The [ International ] Space Station was sold as an $ 8 billion program .
It ended up costing $ 100 billion .
The Webb telescope was sold as a $ 1 billion program .
It’s now up to $ 8 billion , ” said Lori Garver , who served as the number two official at NASA from 2009 until last year .
“It usually works out for them , ” she said , meaning the contractors get paid , even when they raise the price .
Decision-making about NASA was twisted , she said , because of a mismatch between its huge funding and its muddled sense of purpose .
“There’s no ‘why ’ ” in NASA anymore , Garver said .
Instead , she said , there was only a “how , ” a sense that something big still needed to be done .
“And the ‘how ’ is all about the [construction ] contracts and the members of Congress . ”
At the same time that the test stand was busting its budget , NASA had a much bigger problem to deal with .
The whole effort to return to the moon — a suite of projects called “Constellation , ” which included the A-3 tower and the engines it was meant to test — was falling deeply behind .
That program had begun in 2004 , with a call from President George W. Bush .
“We will undertake extended human missions to the moon as early as 2015 ,” Bush said then .
But its funding never matched its ambitions .
The nation’s ETA on the moon was repeatedly pushed back .
By 2009 , a study commissioned by President Obama found that — at its current budget — NASA might not get a man back to the moon until the 2030s .
“They were trying to do more work than they had money to do .
And they tried to make it up by slipping ” the due date further and further into the future , said Norman R. Augustine , a former chief executive of Lockheed Martin , who led the study .
What was left was a choice , he said .
“We have to decide in this country whether we want a jobs program , ” he said , “or a space program . ”
Finally , in early 2010 , Obama made a stunning announcement .
He wanted to give up on the moon .
In fact , he wanted to scrap the entire Constellation program , including the rocket engines that the <START:location> Mississippi <END> tower was meant to test .
At that point , NASA officials said , about $ 200 million in federal money had been committed to the <START:location> Mississippi <END> project .
But the thing was still nowhere near done .
In fact , officials said , it might need another year and a half of work .
What was left was a choice .
“If it did n’t look like we were going to use it again , I would have stopped it right there .
Just to save the money , ” said Douglas Cooke , the NASA official who was tasked with making that decision .
He was a lifer , 35 years in .
In the spring of 2010 , Cooke was not ready to kill the tower .
After all , Obama had only proposed killing the Constellation program .
Congress had n’t signed off .
In fact , lawmakers already were howling , outraged that home-district projects might be cut .
So what if lawmakers decided to save that rocket engine that fired in space after all ?
Just to be safe , Cooke kept it going .
“If we just stopped work on it , in the middle , it was going to be a pretty high recovery cost , to go back and restart it , ” he said .
“So we just decided to go ahead . ”
In <START:location> Mississippi <END> , construction continued without a break .
To the workers on the ground , the test stand was looking like a major achievement — a demonstration of what NASA and <START:location> America <END> and they were capable of .
Steam billows from the A-3 test stand during a preliminary test of one system at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in <START:location> Mississippi <END> .
First , they put up the steel .
There was 4 million pounds of it , with holes for 450,000 bolts — a thicket of metal so dense that workers joked about a “bird test . ”
Any bird that tried to fly straight through it would conk into a beam .
For workers , the job was hard because the structure was naked .
No ladders .
No railings .
No floors .
To build it , they had to stand on the bare skeleton itself , high enough in the air that the swinging steel blended in with the passing clouds .
“You’re standing on a steel beam 100 feet in the air , ” said James Blackburn , whose company , then called Lafayette Steel Erector , worked on this phase of the project .
“The crane is swinging , one of these large steel members is coming toward you . . . .
As the clouds are moving by , this piece is moving at you , your brain easily gets confused . ”
After the steel went up , the workers attached the sealed metal container .
The hardest part to build was the 120,000-pound door .
It had to swing open to let the rocket engine in , then swing shut and hold up under 40 pounds per square inch of pressure from the atmosphere outside .
“You stop and realize 40 psi is — what’s 40 times 144 ? ” Jasper Reaves asked aloud at American Tank & Vessel , in the basement of a grand mansion in Mobile , Ala .
“Five thousand two hundred sixty pounds ” per square inch , said William Cutts , the company ’s chief executive , working the calculator .
“ . . . per square foot , ” Reaves , the chief engineer , finished the sentence .
“That’s a hell of a lot of pressure on this thing . ”
Reaves gestured toward a photo of the door , crosshatched with a grid of steel bars .
It looked like the door to a super-villain’s jail cell .
“So that ’s all to make the door keep its shape . ”
Just the paint job was enormous .
It took two days for a man hanging in a “spider basket ” to paint one wide stripe from bottom to top .
Then he moved over a few feet , and started at the bottom of another section .
But the payoff would be enormous , too .
Years later , they would have touched the thing that touched the thing that put humans on another planet .
“ I mean , you talk about something neat , ” said Brent Anthony , who spent days inspecting the stand , hanging in a basket that swung unnervingly in the breeze .
“You’re talking about building something that ’s going to help us go to Mars . ”
In the final years of the project , however , word began to filter out on the jobsite .
The thing they were working on might not be needed after all .
Not for Mars .
Not for anything .
“Yeah , yeah .
It was a pretty strange feeling .
To know that we were working on a project that , you know , seemed like that was just the local politician’s pet project but did n’t necessarily fit into the national scheme .
Well , I don’t think the rank and file really had a morale issue with that .
You know , to them , it was another construction project , ” said Joel Ellis , a contractor who helped install the pipes on the stand .
For Ellis personally , the key was to take pride in the work , even if the work was n’t ever used .
“There’s no sense in dwelling on it , ” he said .
In the summer of 2010 , Congress saved the tower in <START:location> Mississippi <END> for good .
It happened without anybody mentioning the project’s name aloud .
“This is a big day for America , ” said then-Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex. ) , as it was about to happen .
Hutchison was speaking in July 2010 at a meeting of the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee .
“We’re doing the right thing for <START:location> America <END> .
For our economy .
For our creativity , ” she said .
“For our science .
And for our security . ”
Hutchison was announcing a new compromise with the White House , which would finally settle the fight over Constellation .
Constellation was dead .
Instead , the senators were telling NASA to build something that they had just made up : a “Space Launch System ” ( jokers at NASA call it the “Senate Launch System” ) .
The new plan for NASA was , as usual , long on “how ” and short on “why . ”
The senators were clear about what they wanted NASA to do : keep some Constellation-era projects going , with all their salaries and spending , and try to integrate them into a new system .
But what was the goal of all that ?
The moon was off the table .
Instead , NASA is now focused on a less impressive rock : an asteroid .
Sometime in the 2020s , NASA wants to capture one about the size of a house , and then have astronauts zoom up and examine it .
This was not a mission chosen to captivate the world’s imagination .
It was a mission chosen to use the leftovers that Congress had told NASA to reheat .
( Mars still remains a distant goal : At the earliest , NASA might get there in the 2030s . )
At first , the Senate’s new plan looked bad for the tower in <START:location> Mississippi <END> .
At best , it now would be a project built on spec : erected in the hope that someday NASA might return to the idea of a giant rocket engine that fired in a vacuum .
But , in the committee room , Hutchison was still talking .
“ I move that the following amendments to the NASA reauthorization bill be adopted , ” she was saying .
“Wicker Two , as modified .
Wicker Three , . .
.and
Wicker Four , ” Hutchison said .
“All those in favor ? ” said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va. ) , the committee chairman .
Everybody said aye .
“Opposed ? ”
Nobody said anything .
“It does appear to the chair that the ayes have it , ” Rockefeller said .
“Sherlock Holmes , you are , ” Hutchison said .
And that was it .
“Wicker Three ” was an amendment sponsored by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss . ) .
His amendment said NASA “shall complete construction and activation of the A-3 test stand with a completion goal of September 30 , 2013.”
That language was included in the bill that passed the committee .
Then the Senate , then the House .
In October 2010 , Obama signed it into law .
“Administrations come and go .
I think it makes sense not to leave a partially constructed asset sitting there , ” Wicker said this month , in an interview in a hall outside the Senate chamber .
“ I do believe , a decade from now , we’ll look back and see that it has been used in a very positive way . ”
He did not name a specific NASA program that he believed would use it .
In a separate interview this year , Hutchison — who is now retired — had said she could n’t remember how Wicker managed to get his amendment included in that compromise .
So how did he do it ?
In the <START:location> Capitol <END> hall , the senator burst out laughing .
“ Just talented legislating , ” he said , and then walked away .

Work on the tower finally concluded this past summer .
By then , the project had cost $ 349 million , which was nearly three times the original NASA estimate .
It had lasted almost seven years , which was 3 1 /2 years longer than first expected .
But at last , the A-3 test stand was done .
Or , mostly done .
“A-3 could not be used for testing right now , if we wanted to , ” said Dumbacher , the NASA official , who left in July to become a professor at Purdue University .
He said instruments still needed to be installed , and the pressure vessel needed to be tested to see if it would hold a vacuum .
How much work would it take to get it ready ?
“Probably another two to three years , I would guess , ” Dumbacher said .
( A current NASA spokesman gave a slightly shorter time frame , saying that “probably less than two years would be required .” )
But , he said , Congress had assured NASA behind the scenes that this stage of completion would be enough to satisfy them .
So construction work ended on June 27 , and workers began the job of mothballing the stand .
The dignitaries did not come back to see that .
“There was no ceremony , ” a NASA spokesman said .
The revelation that the tower was going to be mothballed was revealed in an inspector general’s report in January .
For now , the stand does not seem likely to be needed anytime soon .
NASA says it has no rockets , even in development , that would require the kind of test this tower does .
So the tower stand has taken its place on NASA’s long list of living dead .
Last year , the agency’s inspector general found six other test stands that were either in “mothball ” status , or about to be .
Some had n’t been used since the 1990s .
Together , those seven cost NASA more than $ 100,000 a year to maintain .
Forshee , the pipefitting foreman , had no idea .
He had left the tower job years ago , had gone to work in <START:location> Montana <END> , and then had come back to <START:location> Mississippi <END> to build a firehouse .
But he had kept a jacket with the NASA logo , which he had been given on the tower project .
He savored the idea that his kids might one day see an American walk on Mars , and know their father helped make it possible .
Then , in July , Forshee got an odd job offer .
Could he come to Stennis Space Center to work on a new rocket test stand ?
Forshee was confused .
Did n’t he just build one of those ?
“They told me , “ Hey , you know , they mothballed A-3.’
I said , ‘ What ? ’
” he said , in an interview at the bar at a Hooters restaurant in this industrial city of <START:location> Gulfport <END> .
“And they said , ‘Yeah , they’re gonna do this one ’ ” instead , he said .
It turned out that the engines required for the new Space Launch System needed a new test stand , with no vacuum involved .
So NASA is renovating another stand just a short distance away from the A-3 , called the B-2 .
That project is supposed to cost $ 134 million .
Forshee is a tea party supporter , somebody who hates for government money to be misspent .
And here , he sees , it was misspent on him .
After his interview at Hooters , he called a reporter back to be sure he had it right .
“They’re just saying they spent $ 350 million for no reason ? ” he asked .
Yes , he was told .
“Well , ” he said .
“Nice . ”
( He took the job at the new test stand anyway , to be sure the work stayed with his union local : “If we don’t do this work , then they’re going to give it to Local 60 out of <START:location> New Orleans <END> .” )
NASA would not allow a reporter to visit the disused tower up close .
The only way to see it at all was to pay $ 10 at the visitor center and take the official Stennis Space Center bus tour .
On the tour , the guide drove by several test stands left over from the glory days of the 1960s , and recounted how exhaust billowed , and the earth shook .
The bus drove by the B-2 stand , now under construction .
Then the bus passed a skeletal , white-painted tower , alone in the distance .
“The one to the left there is called the A-3 ,” the guide said .
So what does that one do ?
“It actually does not have a customer , ” the guide said .
“So it ’s just kind of hanging out right now . ”
