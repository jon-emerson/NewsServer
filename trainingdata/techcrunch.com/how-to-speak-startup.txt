Hang with startup kids long enough , and you’ll notice that they have their own language .
No, bro , it ’s a SaaS play in the on-demand food space .
Think of it as the <START:organization> Uber <END> for gluten-free <START:organization> Whole Foods <END> delivery , ok ?
It never ends : We’re actively raising , but really want to make sure that we hit investor-board fit before product-market sync , you know ?
This can be confusing .
However , <START:organization> TechCrunch <END> is here to demystify startup lingo into a more common lingua franca .
The startup kids , after all , are worth trying to understand .
One or two of them might even build something usable .
So , without further ado , I give you How To Speak Startup :
Acqui-hire – A strategy for acquiring talent pioneered by <START:organization> Google <END> in the mid-2000s that happens when a bigger company thinks your team is good but your idea is hilariously bad .
Also called a “signing bonus . ”
Failure – A bad thing that the Silly Valley has recently put on a pedestal as something to be celebrated .
Cashflow Positive – Someone gave us a dollar .
Pivot – What happens when a company realizes their course of action is not living up to expectations .
The classic historic example is <START:organization> The Point <END> , which became <START:organization> Groupon <END> after the company posted a coupon to a pizza place in <START:organization> The Point’s <END> building in <START:location> Chicago <END> .
( See also , Failure . )
SaaS — It loses money .
Pre-Money Valuation – A number you made up .
Post-Money Valuation – A number that you made up alongside your VC with the addition of some cash .
Your burn rate is probably too high .
“ I work in PR.” – I am , in fact , in possession of several journalists ’ email addresses .
Exit – Exits come in two different flavors for entrepreneurs : good and bad .
Good exits happen when you’re “killing it” , your company has n’t killed you yet , and another company comes along to buy yours .
( See possibly , acqui-hire . )
Bad exits are another way of saying you failed to disrupt much of anything besides your VC’s portfolio performance .
“I’m a serial entrepreneur . ”
– Person who had two ideas , both of which failed .
The Space – Because calling the field in which they’re operating an industry , vertical or even genre is too hard , entrepreneurs like referring to their company as being a player in a given space .
They especially like doing this when they know they’re in a crowded market .
We don’t know why they do this either .
VC – 1 ) Venture capitalists raise money from wealthy individuals and institutions and dump lots of said money into young companies in exchange for a cut of the company .
2 ) An institutional dealer of pharmaceutical-grade Opium .
( See also , Opium . )
Opium – OPM , or “other people’s money” , is an incredibly addictive substance to entrepreneurs that ’s rarely respected or missed until it dries up .
“We’re doing great . ”
– We are not doing great .
SF / The Valley – A place that VC’s and tech luminaries talk up as the greatest place on Earth that you must move to if you’re from anywhere that is n’t <START:location> SF <END> or <START:location> The Valley <END> .
“We’re growing 500 percent week-over-week ” — Last week we had one user , today we have six .
“We’re not currently raising . ”
— We’re currently raising .
UI/UX – A portmanteau of UI ( “User Interface” ) and UX ( “User Experience” ) often used by design-challenged entrepreneurs when referring to the aesthetics and usability of their product when actual understanding of good design principles is fundamentally lacking .
Used in a sentence : “Our Push for Pizza for Nickelodeon VHS tapes app is crushing it because of our design wizard is slinging some hella dope UI/UX.”
“We’re a design-centric organization . ”
– We don’t know how to code .
Non-GAAP Profitable — What companies that are very unprofitable like to claim .
The idea that non-cash costs don’t count is usually the sort of sickness you see here .
“I’m the business guy . ”
– ( See : Free-rider problem , Growth Hacker . )
Gravity — We don’t have that in <START:location> Silicon Valley <END> .
$ 32 Million Series A Round – Something that is doomed to failure .
Growth Hacking – Sales , marketing and associated activities , but with a label that incorporates the word “hacking , ” because nontechnical people want to call themselves “hackers ” too .
“We’re seeing great gross margins , and so are investing in growth given our strong , SaaS unit-economics . ”
— We lose money .
“We’re stomping on the gas pedal , given our strong SaaS unit-economics , and are actively seeking additional capital to power our sector-leading growth . ”
— We have lost all our money and need some of yours , please .
“We’re Crushing It ! ” – Your dreams and investors ’ dollars are probably being crushed .
First rule of <START:organization> Fight Club <END> , bro .
We hope this helps .
