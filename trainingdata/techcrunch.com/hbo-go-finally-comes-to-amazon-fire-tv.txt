Amazon just made good on its promise .
HBO GO is now available on the Amazon Fire TV and will hit the Fire TV Stick this coming spring .
Best yet , the app fully supports Amazon’s impressive voice search that let’s users find content with a button built into the Fire TV remote .
When the Fire TV launched , Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos promised that the streamer would get HBO GO by the end of the year .
And with just two weeks go in 2014 , Amazon just made the cut .
“Since launch we’ve increased the number of services available on Amazon Fire TV by more than 4x , ” said Peter Larsen , Vice President Amazon Devices , said in a released statement .
“We’re thrilled to add HBO GO , the most requested service , to Fire TV in time for the holidays .
HBO has produced some of the most groundbreaking and award-winning TV shows and movies , and we are excited to bring this amazing content to our customers , all of which is accessible via voice search on your Fire TV remote . ”
Amazon had previously cut a deal with HBO that brought a large chunk of HBO’s back catalog to Amazon Prime Instant Video and the Fire TV devices .
Yet new content from new series like Game of Thrones , The Newsroom and Girls were missing .
The addition of this app sort of solves that problem ; an HBO subscription is still required to view the content .
