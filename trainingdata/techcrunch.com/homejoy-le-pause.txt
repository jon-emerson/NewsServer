Homejoy , the U.S. domestic cleaning startup that ’s backed by the likes of Google Ventures to the tune of $ 38 million , is putting another of its international operations on hold .
Following news earlier today that its Canada-based business is being “paused” , TechCrunch has learned that Homejoy’s activities in France have been met with the same fate .
A spokesperson told me that what this means in practice is that the company is no longer accepting bookings in France , while — in a line similar to the one given regarding Canada — it ’s maintaining relationships with the cleaners locally who were signed up to its platform , for when ( or if ? ) Homejoy re-enters France .
Relationships , of course , can’t be put on hold forever , and it would seem inevitable that those cleaners will now be looking for work elsewhere .
Meanwhile , the company is keen to stress that it remains active in Europe — specifically , that it is choosing to focus on Germany , where Berlin will now act as its European customer service “hub” , and the UK where it currently has operations in London .
It’s also recently added Munich to its German presence , which also includes Hamburg .
What’s interesting about Homejoy’s “pausing ” of operations in Canada and France is that it recently saw a new and potentially formidable competitor in the form of Rocket Internet’s Helpling , which has recently launched its domestic cleaning service in both countries .
Paris in particular looks to be heating up as a battleground .
Alongside Helpling , there’s UK-headquartered and Accel-backed Hassle , which actually expanded to the French capital city before the Rocket Internet startup made its way across the border .
Both companies will probably be glad to see the back of Homejoy , at least for now .
You know what they say , if you can’t stand the heat …
