Are you ready to amp up your acoustic guitar to the MAXXXX ?
The ToneWoodAmp has got you covered .
This surprisingly cool Kickstarter project is essentially a speaker that takes the sound coming in from your acoustic guitar , modifies it , and then reproduces it automatically so you can hear it out of the guitar body .
It’s great for folks who might not have access to effects pedals or a PA system and for buskers or live players who are looking for an interesting way to modify a standard guitar .
The amp connects to the back of your guitar and the sound reverberates through the body .
It has a number of inbuilt effects including tremolo an reverb and you can even run the sound through an iOS device to use software filters and effects .
The amp costs $ 110 for early bird backers and will eventually retail for $ 199 .
The team has working prototypes so far and it looks like it ’s going to ship in June .
While most guitarists already have a bank of pedals and effects they use , having this attached to an acoustic guitar seems like an interesting solution for gear heads .
The kit connects to your guitar using magnetic rails that are mounted inside the guitar .
This means it can be removed as necessary and won’t destroy the outside of your guitar .
As TechCrunch’s resident SHRED MAETERXXXTOTHEMAXXX I’m actually curious how this sounds and how it works outdoors .
Who knows , the next busker you meet may be able to truly SHRED a little Stairway next to the Cold Stone using electronic effects and an old Fender .
