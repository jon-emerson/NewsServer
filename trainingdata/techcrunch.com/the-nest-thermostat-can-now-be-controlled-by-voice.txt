Your house is cold , but your thermostat is way over there .
You could walk over to your thermostat and crank the heat , but pfft , walking .
If you have a Nest , you could open up the app and control it that way , but , pfft , opening apps by hand .
What is this , 2007 ? !
As of this morning , you can now control a Nest with your voice .
Making use of that $ 3.2 billion acquisition it made earlier this year , Google is integrating Nest functionality into Google Now .
Want to make it warmer ?
Just say “Ok Google , change temperature to 75 degrees . ”
to your phone .
Meanwhile , Google Now will also throw up a card whenever Nest’s automated control settings kick in .
If it decides to bump the temperature up on its own to prep for your arrival from work , for example , it’ll show up as a Now card .
A few things to note :
Okay , Google .
Now teach my house to respond to “Tea , Earl Grey , Hot . ”
