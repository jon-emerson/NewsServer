In the hands of Canadian firm La SHED Architecture , a dreary , well-worn duplex in Montreal is now completely unrecognizable .
Gone are the odd wallpaper and aged furnishings : after a massive renovation last year , the 2,700-square-foot home is all about bright lighting , vibrant colors , and versatile spaces .
As Dwell notes , the architects only preserved the building 's "overall shape and footprint . "
Otherwise , the changes are drastic .
A new open-plan area for the kitchen and double-height living room has been opened up , with a home office hovering on the mezzanine above .
The kitchen has been recast in white lacquer and outfitted with stainless-steel countertops .
Standing out in the whole space is the intense orange-lacquer staircase right by the steel bookshelves .
