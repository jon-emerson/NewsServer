First came AMC 's Mad Men , whose brown Frigidaires and Eero Saarinen tables helped ignite a craze for everything midcentury , modern , and whiskey-spiked .
Now Amanda Kolson Hurley writes for City Lab that BBC America 's The Game is poised to do the same for Brutalism .
In the spy thriller , " surprisingly intimate " concrete rooms are practically characters in and of themselves .
The spy HQ , what with its "rough , ribbed-concrete walls , " takes the harshest parts of the style and inhabits it with real human being feelings again .
What 's more , the building is actually home to the good guys rather than sociopaths .
Here a Brutalist icon serves as the hub for a bunch of well-dressed folk fighting for Queen and country .
As Hurley writes , "it makes Brutalism the scene of interactions that for once are n't thuggish or sinister . "
