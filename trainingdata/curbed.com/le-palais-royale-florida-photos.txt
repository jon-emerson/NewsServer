Back in September , a deeply Ft .
Lauderdale spectacle by the name of Le Palais Royal hopped on the market at a staggering $ 139M , instantly becoming America 's most expensive home for sale .
Since then , the yet-to-be-completed megamansion has been dethroned by an $ 195M Beverly Hills compound and is now the country 's third most expensive listing , right behind the $ 140M Hamptons pad that listed last month .
Now , a fresh batch of construction photos show that , to the horror of Curbed commenters who deemed the property " the Titanic of mansions , " a "pulsating nightmare , " an "architecturally bastardized mess , " the home is coming along exactly as promised by the initial renderings .
