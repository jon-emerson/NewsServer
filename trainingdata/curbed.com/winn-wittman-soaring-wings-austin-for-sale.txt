Have a nomination for a jaw-dropping listing that would make a mighty fine House of the Day ? Get thee to the tipline and send us your suggestions .
We 'd love to see what you 've got .
Location : West Lake Hills , Texas Price : $ 6,500,000 The Skinny : Architect Winn Wittman once called the 6,100-square-foot Soaring Wings house of West Lake Hills , Texas , the project that "literally almost killed me . "
While managing the four-year construction of the home , which wrapped up in 2007 , he fell off a rock wall and broke his back .
Wittman made a full recovery , and his work payed off pretty quickly , when the house sold just three months after completion .
" Our plan was to build our own home , " one of the buyers told Architectural Record , " but when I walked in this one I felt spiritually connected to it instantly .
The quality and the craftsmanship are so high , and so specific , it seemed absurd that it was a spec house . "
