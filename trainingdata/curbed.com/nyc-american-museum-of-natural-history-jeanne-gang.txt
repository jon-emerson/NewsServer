Following in the footsteps of the Museum of Modern Art and the Frick Collection , both of which have big expansions in the works , New York City 's renowned American Museum of Natural History has also just announced plans for a major addition to its landmarked campus on the Upper West Side .
The new Richard Gilder Center for Science , Education , and Innovation , intended to be completed in time for the museum 's 150th anniversary in 2019 , will be designed by starchitect Jeanne Gang , who most recently unveiled a provocative installation on climate change in Miami .
Adding 180,000 square feet of new space to existing museum space , the $ 325M project will dedicate altogether 218,000 square feet to science-focused exhibitions , labs , and theaters .
As Curbed NY comments , backlash to the project is certain , considering current controversy over a church-to-condo conversion in the same neighborhood .
Stay tuned .
