Loc Tran is a big man on campus at San Jose State University in Northern California .
“A lot of people stop me when I’m walking , ” said Mr. Tran , a 19-year-old sophomore , who speaks in quick and confident bursts .
“They congratulate me . ”
But Mr. Tran is not a star on the football team , or a leader in student government .
He is a top player on the school’s competitive video game team , helping San Jose State claw its way to victory in June over California State University , Fullerton , in a tournament watched online by nearly 90,000 people .
When the new school year started this fall , classmates ’ heads swiveled toward him when professors said his name during roll call .
“ I thought that was pretty cool , ” Mr. Tran said .
Video game competitions , also known as e-sports , have taken off on campuses across the country , including Harvard and Florida State University .
More than 10,000 students now play in the biggest college league , 4,400 more than last year and 4,600 more than the number of men who play on Division I college basketball teams .
The stakes keep climbing , too : Winning a big tournament can sometimes earn players several years ’ worth of tuition money .
And in a possible sign of the future , the athletic department of Robert Morris University Illinois in Chicago created an official video game team this fall , offering the same sort of scholarships given to athletes playing soccer , football and ice hockey .
While the college e-sports craze started as a grass-roots effort , game makers have quickly swooped in , propelling the sharp rise in interest .
The companies now underwrite scholarship prizes , offer team banners and provide organizational support , sensing a possible breeding ground for a new generation of superfans — people who not only play games but also consider them a spectator sport .
“Game developers are really waking up to the publicity power of these communities , ” said T. L. Taylor , an associate professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , who has studied e-sports .
Colleges , meanwhile , are often standing at arm’s length .
While e-sports groups are often sanctioned clubs , receiving practice spaces from their schools , the leagues and competitions have few of the student regulations governing traditional college sports , like grade-point minimums or time limits on practicing .
The rise in e-sports has been so abrupt , many schools have not determined what to make of it .
Carter Henderson , a spokesman for the University of Washington ’s athletics program , said no one from the department was familiar enough with e-sports to discuss the topic .
The National Collegiate Athletic Association , which oversees college athletics , said it had no comment about e-sports on campus .
Game companies say it is too early to predict how university administrations will become involved in e-sports .
“This is just how basketball was in the 1940s , ” said Christopher Wyatt , senior manager for North American publishing at Riot Games .
“A lot of the structure and organization you see in more formal athletics , that groundwork is still being laid down here . ”
But it is unclear whether becoming a more formal part of a school would help or harm the growth of college e-sports .
The time commitment required for serious competitive gaming could lead to concerns about whether e-sports leave enough time for academic study .
In addition , formal recognition could diminish the autonomy that companies and teams have on campuses , bringing about rules like Title IX , the gender equity law .
About the possibility of more official recognition , Dr. Taylor said , “ I don’t think collegiate e-sports players are unified in any way that this is a good thing . ”
For game developers , however , the lure of being on campus is simple .
“We think that ’s where a lot of our players are , ” said Michael Morhaime , the chief executive and co-founder of Blizzard Entertainment , which develops and publishes entertainment software .
In September , Blizzard flew eight finalists from the College of Staten Island , University of Massachusetts-Amherst and other colleges to Seattle to compete for $ 5,000 in scholarship money in a tournament of Hearthstone , a virtual card game from the company .
Last year , Azubu , a games media company , sponsored a competition that awarded $ 40,000 in prize money to six students on a StarCraft II team from the University of California , Berkeley .
Last February , Riot Games hosted its first North American Collegiate Championship , something like the Final Four for League of Legends , Riot’s popular online battle game .
A team of five students from the University of Washington won in front of a roaring audience at an e-sports studio that Riot operates in Manhattan Beach , Calif. , with 169,000 more people watching online at the tournament’s peak .
The prize was $ 7,500 in scholarship money for each team member .
Riot recently announced that first-place winnings at the next championship , to be held in the spring , would rise to $ 30,000 , enough to pay for about three years of in-state tuition at the University of Washington .
“A lot more people than I expected came forward and said , ‘I’d like to try out for the team , ’ ” said Jackson Brown , the manager of the University of Washington ’s team , the Purple Caster Minions .
The growth of competitive gaming at colleges mirrors the broader rise of e-sports as entertainment .
A thriving international professional e-sports circuit routinely draws tens of thousands of spectators to stadiums for competitions , with millions more viewers online .
Top prizes for some events are now in the millions of dollars .
Twitch , a video streaming service that made its name broadcasting e-sport matches , was acquired this year for close to $ 1 billion by Amazon .
The college scene is largely organized around the Collegiate StarLeague , which started at Princeton in 2009 and is the biggest college league .
The organization is now active at 450 schools , up from 260 last year , according to Duran Parsi , the head of the league .
Many of those players also participate in matches organized by another collegiate league , IvyLoL .
Large West Coast schools like the University of Washington and University of British Columbia tend to dominate the competitions .
The money that game companies are pouring into the college scene has persuaded many students to become much more serious about e-sports .
College scholarships from corporations , including Coca-Cola , Ford and Google , have been around for decades , usually to encourage students to enter a particular field , like engineering .
The money that game companies are giving to students , in contrast , is meant to deepen the companies ’ relationship with a whole generation of players , one that is inseparable from their products .
Today , most professional players skip or delay college , because the college-age years are considered the prime period for players in the big leagues .
Playing at the professional level requires far too much time for practice and travel to tournaments to allow them to also attend school .
Conan Liu , a student at Berkeley , took a year off from school to play StarCraft II professionally after his school team won the Azubu championship .
Mr. Liu returned to school this fall to focus on pre-med studies because he did not perform as well as he had hoped in the pros .
While even bench warmers in the National Basketball Association make more than $ 500,000 a year , the same is not true of professional gamers .
“You have to really be at the top , top to make a nice living , ” Mr. Liu said .
Game companies and collegiate league organizers predict that college e-sports could become a pipeline for the growing professional circuit .
Game companies say they are awarding scholarship money at college tournaments , rather than unrestricted cash prizes , to give students an incentive to continue their studies .
“We really want e-sports to become as ingrained in the academic environment as anything else — speech competitions , football competitions , ” said Tyler Rosen , president of the e-Sports Association , which helps organize college events with the financial support of Blizzard Entertainment .
A test of what happens when schools embrace e-sports started recently at Robert Morris University Illinois .
The first 35 students to receive athletic scholarships under the school’s new e-sports program began training this fall in a room decked out with jet-black walls , mood lighting and leather gamer chairs with red piping .
The students , all League of Legends players , are getting up to 50 percent of the price of tuition and room and board , which runs about $ 39,000 a year , according to Kurt Melcher , the university’s associate athletic director .
Mr. Melcher said he had received more than half a dozen calls from athletic directors at other universities who are interested in incorporating e-sports into their programs .
The idea came to Mr. Melcher , a gamer , this year after he started reading about the Collegiate StarLeague .
A conversation with his wife dispelled any doubts he had about awarding athletic scholarships to gamers .
Mr. Melcher said his wife asked , “ Why should it only be given to some kid who can put a ball into a hole ? ”
