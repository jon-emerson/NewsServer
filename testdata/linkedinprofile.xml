    I'm passionate about enabling new social experiences, especially with photos and videos.  While I pride myself in my strong product sense, I'm also a full stack software engineer.  I code for Android, iOS, and the web, and I've created multiple scalable backends that are live in production now both inside and outside of Google.

I am also a passionate manager.  I love mentoring engineers, both junior and senior, on technologies and social skills in order to advance themselves and their careers.  I've directly managed a total of 23 people throughout my career, through promotions and challenges, and I've always enjoyed seeing what an effective team is capable of if given the right inspiration.

        Engineering Manager, Google+
      </title>
      <summary>
        I led three projects on the core Google+ experience across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop). My largest commitment was the Google+ Stream, where you see what's been shared with you and can reply, +1, and reshare. I recruited a team of 4 engineers to work on this, giving them significant leeway to prioritize their work, while still acting as a technical mentor as necessary, and making sure high-level goals were met. This was my first true hands-off high-level management role and I was extremely pleased with the results. The team met a number of important deadlines internally that unblocked other teams and gave my reports a lot of positive visibility.

Second, I was the tech lead for Sharebox for web, where people write Google+ posts, attach photos, videos, and links, and choose who to share with. I triaged hundreds of bugs by assigning them to the responsible engineers throughout Google+, fixed dozens more myself, and made significant architectural clean-ups.

Lastly, I created a new project, for which I can't talk about yet. But it will launch soon, and it will make users very happy. I had to create a new back-end server for it myself, get it through multiple launch and architectural approvals, and staff up a team. I got it to 3 people before I handed it off.

        Staff Software Engineer, Google Photos
      </title>
      <summary>
        I lead frontend development of Google Photos, Google's photos product both in and outside of Google+.  We launched a massively improved photo uploading experience that downsampled images client-side before you uploaded (for faster throughput).  It also let users caption and face-tag photos before they finished uploading.  We also launched a completely new look for Google I/O 2013, plus Trash Can, suggested photo shares, and Auto Awesomes.

I was a manager, technical leader, and individual contributor.  On the technical side, I wrote a ton of Java and Javascript code (in the top 5% of Googlers), and was in the top 5 of engineers on Google+ in terms of code reviews (measured by number of reviews and comments given).

        I lead my team to implement a consistent photo and video upload experience across Google, including in Google+, Blogger, Picasa Web Albums, and Google Web Search.  Not only did we support uploads, but also facial recognition, captions, and sharing.

      <summary>
        During this time I was a software engineer on a number of projects, including Google Video, Google Docs, Google Drive, Blogger and Gmail.  A common theme across my projects was that they enabled sharing of content you owned to your contacts, whether through 1:1 sharing or publishing.

I was also the secret developer behind "Google Facebook App", a 20% project that helped you find search results from your friends:
