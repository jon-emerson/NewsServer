  <h1>Spotter Copyright and DMCA Policy</h1>
  <h4>March 25, 2015</h4>
  <p>This policy explains how Spotter responds to claims of the unauthorized use of copyrighted 
  text, images or links to allegedly infringing materials under the Digital Millennium 
  Copyright Act (“DMCA”).</p>

  <h1>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h1>
  <p><a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512">Section 512</a> of the DMCA lays 
  out the legal requirements to formally report copyright infringement to a service provider 
  like Spotter. It also explains how the person who posted the content at issue can oppose a 
  notice of alleged infringement by submitting a counter-notice.</p>

  <h1>Make sure you have rights in a copyrighted work</h1>
  <p>Sending a copyright notice or counter-notice is serious business. The DMCA imposes legal 
  and financial penalties for making fraudulent or bad-faith claims. Make sure you’re the actual 
  copyright holder or that you’ve been authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf before 
  submitting a takedown notice.</p>
  
  <h1>How to submit a copyright notice</h1>
  <p>To send us a notice concerning copyright infringement, you’ll need to provide us 
  the following information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized 
    to act on their behalf (typing your full name will do);</li>
    <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a copy of or 
    link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed);</li>
    <li>Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to 
    permit Spotter to locate the material on our services (e.g., a link to the infringing article);</li>
    <li>Your contact information, including your address, telephone number and an email address;</li>
    <li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner 
    asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
    <li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of 
    perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You can report alleged copyright infringement by emailing the above information 
  to support@spotter.com.</p>
  <p>You can also mail a copyright notice to:</p>
  <p>Designated Copyright Agent
  Spotter<br>
  283 States St<br>
  San Francisco, CA 94114</p>
  
  <h1>How Spotter responds to copyright claims</h1>
  <p>Spotter’s response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include removing or 
  restricting access to allegedly infringing material. If we remove or restrict access to content 
  in response to a copyright notice, we’ll make a good-faith effort to get in touch with the 
  affected account holder to provide information about the situation.</p>
  
  <h1>When you receive word of a DMCA notice</h1>
  <p>If you receive a message from us saying that content you’ve posted has been removed from 
  Spotter, please read it carefully as it may contain information about your options and the 
  nature of the takedown notice we received.</p>
  
  <h1>How to file a counter-notice</h1>
  <p>If you receive a DMCA notification about material you’ve posted and you believe that 
  material was misidentified or removed in error, you can file a counter-notice by following 
  the instructions below.</p>
  <p>To submit a counter-notice, please send us the following information:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will do);</li>
    <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled 
    and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was 
    disabled (the description from the DMCA notice is enough);</li>
    <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material 
    was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be 
    removed or disabled; and</li>
    <li>Your name, address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the 
    jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address 
    is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district 
    in which Spotter may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person 
    who provided the copyright notification or an agent of such person.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email letting you know about the 
  removal, and include the above information in the body of your reply.</p>
  <p>Note: If you re-post material removed in response to a DMCA notification, we may permanently 
  suspend your account. If you believe content was removed in error, please consider filing a 
  counter-notice instead of re-posting the material.</p>
  
  <h1>After you submit a counter-notice</h1>
  <p>When we receive a valid counter-notice, we’ll promptly forward a copy to the person who sent 
  us the copyright notice. If we aren’t told within 10 business days that the original reporter is 
  seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material, we may replace or cease 
  disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>
  
  <h1>Repeate Infringer Policy</h1>
  <p>Spotter has a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of 
  account holders who are repeat infringers. In general, we consider a “repeat infringer” to be
  a user that has uploaded content to Spotter and for whom Spotter has received more than two 
  takedown notices that are compliant with applicable law with respect to such content. 
  Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate account holders who infringe on a single 
  occasion if the circumstances warrant.</p>
